Annie is clearly stronger when her stun is ready, and when she has 3 stacks on her Passive. Whenever she has her stun ready, you need to respect her damage output and her ability to trade with you. Annie is strong during the mid-game and in team fights (if she can get a multi-person stun). If possible, do not walk around the map alone and without your team.

It will have a reduced cooldown and will deal a heavier amount of damage.His ability to pick enemies off during this phase of the game is massive.

It allows him to 1 v 1 targets with ease while also ensuring that he can escape in time should the enemy team decide to collapse on him.He can pretty much duel any enemy during this stage of the game. This is quite a boon as he can make multiple enemies come to him while his team gets objectives."}

With your poke, you can quite easily zone the enemy laners off without even getting close to them.Your brush power is unparalleled and one rotation of your spells on an unsuspecting enemy will force them to play defensively.

Try to focus her down as soon as possible so she is unable to dish out lots of damage. If she is being protected, try to flank her.

Adjust your playstyle to be more defensive and play safer during this phase of the game.Avoid detaching from your ADC when Swain's E ability (Nevermove) is up, as it can interrupt your W (You and Me!).

The best place to do so will be in the unwarded areas of the map and in choke points.Once he gets to level 16, he will have 3 points in his Ultimate m. This increases the overall damage output and will let Jarvan use the ability quite often. It will help his team follow up on fights with ease.Jarvan becomes really tanky during the late game.

This can hamper him from CS\u2019ing and will set him back massively.Extremely weak against all-in champions, especially ones who have dashes or blinks.

It has a short cooldown so he will be able to play aggressively over and over again.Once Fizz has recalled and picked up his first item, he\u2019ll be able to dish out of a lot of damage quite quickly.

The fact that it can block the Ignite tick damage in itself can be tilting for her enemies. When used properly, she can even CC a group of enemy champions by countering any source of enemy CC.If she manages to find someone separated from their team, she can one vs one them easily, even if she is behind. This is due to the amount of damage that she can dish out with her Passive and her Ultimate R. Such picks can easily allow her to pressurize and take over a portion of the map."}

They increase your damage output and you can quite literally 1 v 1 squishy champions if you collect enough of them. Besides, your auto-attack AoE slow will play a major role during team fights.During objective fights, always try to CC the enemy Jungler due to them possessing the Smite summoner spell.

While his Q doesn\u2019t deal a lot of damage in the early game, the slow it provides is very handy when it comes to ganking his allies.Once Dr Mundo has completed his first item, his damage output and overall tankiness will increase.

It's crucial to be cautious and avoid getting caught by her crowd control, as it can lead to your demise or that of your ADC. Position yourself defensively and be prepared to detach and use your E (Zoomies) for the speed boost to help dodge her abilities during fights.When engaging in poke or dismounting to auto-attack, try to anticipate Nami's Aqua Prison and actively dodge it. Utilize the speed boost from your E ability to help you sidestep her skill shots more effectively, increasing your chances of avoiding her crowd control.Consider investing in healing reduction items early in the game to counter Nami's sustain.

This is because he can easily blow enemies up with his w > s combo. Sometimes a single combo is all it takes to kill a target (like a squishy support, for instance).Jayce won't spike at level 16 either because his Ultimate G won't be providing with him a lot of raw stats, which other champions' ultimates offer them with.

Poke and harass the enemy Mid laner and force them away from the objective to make it easier to secure the mid lane tower.Whenever your Ultimate 2 is up, try to use it on the enemy laners to get their health low.

This will make it impossible for him to land his Q and potentially stun you.

But, just like in the mid-game, she cannot use it during a team fight which is one of her many downfalls.In the late game, Cait would\u2019ve reached 100% crit strike.
