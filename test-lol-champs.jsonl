If they die at the beginning, you will not be able to win the fight alone.\n\nFocus the nearest enemy champion to your carries and work as a team to take down the enemy one by one. If you focus on the backline alone, you may be an easy target for the enemy and may die quickly. By focusing on the nearest champion, you will survive for longer and keep your carries alive.

It will give him a massive damage boost, and the low cooldown combined with the knockback will help him pick high-priority targets.\n\nGragas will either be extraordinarily tanky or a glass cannon dependent on landing his combo depending on the build. As a Jungler, Gragas will mostly be the latter, so his main goal will be to blow up the enemy backline when he gets the chance.\n\nHis dash and Ultimate R make up for a significant amount of peel for his carries. Should he go for the tank build route, he will successfully absorb much damage for his team while his team follows up on Gragas' engagement."}

It is highly beneficial for her team as that ability does a lot of damage and can completely change the tide of a fight.\n\nAt level nine, Gwen will be able to max out her Q.

It can let him pick off the enemy backline should he decide to go for the entire AP build.

This can also bait the enemy team into wasting a lot of valuable summoner spells.\n\nHis E allows him to do more damage in 1 v 1\u2019s (as the damage is increased if the enemy is alone). This lets him do a lot of damage with one complete rotation of his abilities, and unlike Garen, the enemy probably won\u2019t be able to regenerate a lot of health and stay in the lane.\n\nHe is really good when flanking the enemy team with his Q and E.

She can easily be zoned out of CS, which is not a good thing for her as she needs her core items to be useful.\n\nHer effectiveness will decrease if she runs out of mana in the lane.
