Before the major objective battles, use your k to spot around the death of the brushes set up by the enemy. In addition, always keep your range and use your Q and slow self-attack to kite constantly the enemy team.

Fizz has to go ahead early to do well in the last stages of the game. If he loses the track or doesn't have a lot of gold, he won't be much threat in the middle of the game."}
{"text": "His early play is very weak and he can be killed countless amounts of time during this phase. If he is not able to get his peaks of the article early, he will take enough time to come online. Can easily camp throughout the laning phase. This can hinder him from CS. This can put him back massively in place. Extremely weak against all-in champions, especially those who have dashes or blinks. He is also vulnerable every time he doesn't have Flash early, so good wave management can really be devastating for him."}
{"text": "Several points in his Ultimate R will allow him to use it frequently and increase the damage. It will be a huge ability during the middle of the game. Mid-game is really good for Pyke because he can secure several peaks on the enemy team, especially on the enemy Support if he manages to catch them out of sight. His team fight is pretty good because his Ultimate R can finally allow him to turn the tide of a fight. The Q can allow him to separate targets from their team and kill them."}
{"text": "Peeling for your carries in the late-game team fights is essential to increase your team's chances of winning the fight. If they die at the beginning, you will not be able to win the fight alone.\n\nDo not get picked off during this phase of the game, as you will end up losing crucial objectives if you do so. Stick with your team and rely on picks to make team fights uneven.\n\nFocus the nearest enemy champion to your carries and work as a team to take down the enemy one by one. If you focus on the backline alone, you may be an easy target for the enemy and may die quickly. By focusing on the nearest champion, you will survive for longer and keep your carries alive."}
{"text": "Nearly uncatchable due to his Passive and his g. He can deal consistent amounts of damage, which becomes quite hefty during the mid-late game fights.\n\nCan force the Jungler to pay special attention to him, relieving pressure from other lanes. Probably the only champion who can proxy farm and safely get away due to his kit.\n\nHis Ultimate n gives him additional stats which can temporarily allow him to soak a lot of damage and dish more damage as well. He can act as a front line for his team this way."}
{"text": "Quite still, which can lead him to be camped a lot during the laning phase. Once handed over at the beginning of the game, he was not able to cover much damage. Missing his E, Mordekaiser's opponents, can easily all-in and engage on him. That's because he was not able to move the enemy team, and the carts will be able to him freely. The first grise injuries can reduce his W damage by many. This will help his enemy even out of the duel during the start of the match."}
{"text": "If Rengar falls behind in the early game, it will be really hard for him to get back into the game.\n\nHis W is his major defensive tool. In team fights, if he uses it at the wrong time, he will get CC\u2019d, and locked down by the enemy.\n\nWill struggle getting picks when teams group as 5."}
{"text": "Kled's Passive is heavily underrated, but that will make all the difference in the game now. He can use it to soak up so much damage without the risk of dying, and he can quickly remount if Skaarl flees.\n\nKled will have his build almost completed by now. This means that he will be tanky, as well as dish out heavy amounts of damage. Anyone who gets caught out by him will probably end up dying.\n\nSince all his abilities will be maxed at this point, Kled will be huge in the game. His ability to disrupt the enemy teams' ranks will be phenomenal, and he can easily peel for his carries as well."}
{"text": "Lulu is strong at level 6 as her Ultimate R provides tons of utility and increases her or her ADC\u2019s survivability.\n\nOnce Lulu has completed her first item, her protection and shielding ability will increase dramatically. At this stage, she will also do a hefty amount of damage when trading.\n\nLulu is very good in team fights as she will build items that buff her team up.

Once Twitch has obtained the hurricane of Runaan, its release of damage will be fatal."}

Her damage and CC are pretty substantial, especially if she can use the lane brushes.\n\nLevel 6 is a decent powerspike as Seraphine will get her Ultimate R and can now change the tide of a fight if the enemy team is stacked together or is standing in a line.\n\nThe first item component increases her damage and allows her to use her abilities a bit more frequently. She is still mana-hungry, so she will need to be careful about spamming spells.        "}
{"text": "Level six is a massive power peak. It allows it to use capacity as a finishing movement if it can get the enemy quite low with its E. It can also be used defensively in some cases. The first element will help Tristana win battles easily. Its damage will be amplified by a fairly decent amount."}
{"text": "When she reaches level 6, she can set up her Jungler to inflate your way and kill you. Keep this in mind post 6. She is good in team fights thanks to the great ray on her Ultimate R. Once she has finished her Mythic article, her utility, peeling and trading potential increases sharply."}
{"text": "Never move alone now, because you kill is very easy. Stay with your damage dealers and keep them alive at all costs. Your ultimate R will be on an extremely low cooling during this part of the game. Make sure you use it as and when necessary because you don't want crucial teammates to die unnecessarily. Make sure you use your E correctly. Chokepoint fights are crucial, but you can also use it to disrupt the wisers because they are powerful enough now."}
{"text": "The first component of Ziggs will give it a boost and mana pool. It will allow it to frequently use its Q to continue to hit the enemy and force them to remember abruptly. Level 6 is a massive power peak for Ziggs because it has access to a finishing capacity that is AoE in nature. It can also use it to help teammates finish targets while wandering around. Its Q is really heinous, and it just becomes more powerful by adding points to that ability. This will allow it to burst the enemies quickly, and it will push the wave quickly. This will allow it to sit its enemy tower languish."}
{"text": "While she doesn't have a Ultimate R combat, her Ultimate R is an excellent roaming tool that can allow her to return to the line quickly and also wander around the map and help her allies. She can blow up enemies who are alone when she is in front. Look for spikes on squissy and still targets to get a lead further."}
{"text": "An additional point in his Ultimate R will increase his overall damage and allow him to use the ability frequently. He will help him massively during team fighting or trying to secure peaks. His first ability will be maximized at level 9. This increases his damage, and his team fighting potential will be respectable enough now. He will pose a lot of threats if he can use the ability by hiding in a brush. His tankness will be colossal during this phase of the game. He will absorb the turn shots and enemy damage simultaneously and make it very easy for his allies to follow his commitments."}
{"text": "Try and keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map early. Doing so will make his all-in less effective.\n\nPost 6, try to interrupt or somehow force Akshan to top his Ultimate. This will increase your survivability and it will be put on a short cooldown.\n\nKeep in mind that early armor will be very beneficial in this matchup. Akshan is an AD champion, so picking up early armor will protect you from some of his damage.\n"}
{"text": "Do not separate from them or get away from them otherwise the enemy may try to take you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you are away from your team. Avoid fighting in the late game unless your Ultimate R or Zhonya. Hurglass is in place. Do not fight or hug with the enemy until they are both. Being killed could cost you the game.

In team fighting, use your power to provide a great shield to your allies. Unless you need to use your Qor d, you should try to use your d to help them survive. Stay with your allies in the middle of the game. Don't get too far away from them at any time as you will be an easy target for the enemy. Similarly, don't go to the guard unless your allies are nearby and able to help you."}
{"text": "It has no form of mobility and can easily be all-in-one once its E is down. Any killing against it puts it back by miles as it is a large-scale ADC, and needs firmness in complete safety. Atrocious early play as it does not damage during this stage and is very vulnerable to all-in. It can easily be zoned out of CS, which is not a good thing for it because it needs its basic items to be useful. Its effectiveness will decrease if it runs away from mana in the track. This is due to the way its Q rockets operate. It will remove its long-range CS capability, which will allow the enemy to zone it easily."}
{"text": "Level 6 is a massive peak for Mordekaiser because it can now use its Ultimate R and 1 v 1 whatever it wants. The first element will allow it to fight more effectively. Its damage will be quite important as well."}
{"text": "At level 16, you would\u2019ve put the third point in her Ultimate. Her Ultimates cooldown will be a little lower at this time, so you need to play around it as much as possible.\n\nIn the late game, Camille will deal a lot of damage but also be quite tanky, so you should look to peel and protect your carries.\n\nThe longer the game goes, the more items you can purchase. You will be stronger as the game goes along.\n"}
{"text": "Riven is an early game dominant champion who can take over the lane through short trades. Try not to trade with her unless you can match her trading potential.\n\nRiven will often play hyper-aggressive and try to outplay you with her e. If possible, try to bait out her main abilities and then re-engage when she has cooldowns. This is your best bet when laning against a Riven.\n\nKeep the minion wave frozen near your Tower. If you are playing close to your Tower, her all-in potential is limited as the Tower will protect you and she will not be able to look for frequent trades."}
{"text": "In the late game, continue to split push if your team isn\u2019t at risk of dying or getting caught out.\n\nIf your team is going to get caught out or if the game isn\u2019t one-sided, you need to group with your team to help them fight.\n\nPlay on the side of the map that has the next major objective up so you can rotate to take it with your team. Alternatively, if you have Teleport, you can go to the bot side of the map and use it to get to your team."}
{"text": "Cassiopeia has a lot of kill pressure in the mid-game, especially once she puts 2 points in her Ultimate R. The reduced cooldown and additional damage make her a huge threat during this stage of the game.\n\nCass should have her Tear stacked by this stage of the game. She will have a somewhat endless mana pool once it\u2019s maxed out.\n\nAt level 9, Cass will max out her E. As long as she lands her Q, her bully potential will be incredibly potent. Her all-in heavily intensifies at this stage of the game."}
{"text": "Once Lillia reaches level 6, her pressure of gank and kill will increase thanks to her Ultimate R. Take note that she will be harder to kill at that time. Lillia's early match is rather weak. If you are a strong champion of the beginning of the game, try to invade and put it behind. Once Lillia completes her juggling element, its clearance speed, the release of damage and the pressure of gank will increase."}
{"text": "Her all-in potential post-six is really strong. This allows her to burst down any squishy target she manages to land her Q on, making it very hard for the enemy squishies to push up in their lanes.\n\nUnlike her counterparts, Diana has built-in tankiness which allows her to all-in with her Q, t, and Ultimate R combo quite easily. This is highly valuable when trying to take out a group of three or more champions, especially when the enemy team is unaware of your position.\n\nPossibly one of the best flankers in the game. She can take out the enemy backline almost instantaneously during a team fight if she is left unchecked. Besides, if she happens to get caught, her tankiness and defensive items will keep her alive for quite some time."}
{"text": "You can use it to your advantage by invading and trying to fight it if you are a strong champion from the beginning of the game like Hecarim, Lee Sin or Elise. Post 6, fighting Lillia will be harder than her Ultimate R can put you to sleep. Unless you can kill her quickly, it will be difficult to win a fight against her unless you are in advance. Vision will make Glove harder for Lillia, especially post 6. Placing the vision around her entrances in the jungle and in the river will make it very difficult for her to find successful ganks."}
{"text": "Take care of its poke and range advantage during laning. Defend the minion wave to force it to choose between pushing and throwing simultaneously. Let it push you into your tower early; coordinate with your jungler for potential ganks. Be careful of the increased pressure of its ultimate kill at level 6; remember if you are weak in health."}
{"text": "Make sure there's always a minion between you and Pyke at any time so it's harder for him to land his Q. Pyke will try to push the wave as soon as possible so he can get a quick return and get his first article. Harass and get him down so he has to remember before he can get enough gold for Dirk. Pyke is a great traveling champion. Once he gets mobility boots, expect him to wander frequently. Ping every time he leaves the road so your teammates know he's missing. Try to match his push power so you don't lose your turn if he's wandering."}
{"text": "Jarvan IV is a strong early play duel, so it should be easy for you all in your enemy regularly and continue cutting them in the track using track brushes. You will need to help your Jungler in case it is near your track and try to get off the Rift Herald. The goal is to make sure that you can use your CC combo efficiently regularly. Getting your Ultimate m will help you a lot in this matchup, especially during neutral objective fighting where you can lock the enemy Jungler with ease."}
{"text": "Try flancing in the team fights with your Q and t to access the enemy rear line and close them. Flank on the side instead of running directly to the enemy as they will be able to disengage or drop you. When no team fight occurs, go on a side track and push. It is important that you continue to grow during the middle of the game so that you can get your items as quickly as possible. Do not stay right in the middle if you can't get anything done. Avoid overextension or die alone. When you are dead, the enemy may be able to sit a goal, start a fight or secure the Baron or Dragon."}
{"text": "Its Q alone can force the enemy to remember at the base if it continues to be labelled by it. Can move enemy units in its E using its W. This can act as a really good finishing movement against weak enemies, or it can be used to fire an escape when necessary. Is a threat to remember against as a bad reminder can allow it to take the enemy tower very quickly due to its Passive and W."}
{"text": "Nasus will seek to divide the thrust throughout the middle of the game. It is good to divide the thrust thanks to his Q. When Nasus is divided push, you can use the number advantage to start a team fight. During the fight, check the map and keep an eye on Nasus. Be ready to disengage if he is about to take a turn. If Nasus gathers for team fights, try to lock him up with CC so that he is unable to get on your portages and kill them with his Q and R."}
{"text": "Nidalee will be strong enough once she has a few points in her s. Her Spears deal a lot of damage, so make sure to avoid them. Nidalee doesn't peak as much on level 6 as other champions she already has her Ultimate r at level 1. Once she's finished her Jungling element, her damage exit will be very good. Avoid fighting her unless you can catch her out of her position or if you're stronger than her."}
{"text": "Once Neeko reaches level 6, her death pressure increases. During her struggle, keep in mind that she can throw her Ultimate R and inflict damage and CC you. When Neeko finished her first element, she will have tons of free wave and will be able to push the wave very quickly. You will need to make sure that you can push the wave so that you don't lose your turn early. Neeko is good in team fights thanks to her Ultimate R. Disengage as soon as you see her channel her Ultimate R."}
{"text": "Orianna is not the strongest laner, but she has a lot of poke early thanks to her d and d. Once Orianna reaches level 6, her death pressure and survival increases. At this point, she will be more dominant of the way. Team fights are really where Orianna shines like her Ultimate d is a great AOE ability that can turn the tide of team struggle. Always keep an eye on that her Ball d is attached also and try to stay as far as possible."}
{"text": "Just like in the middle of the game, you have to stay with your support throughout the later parts of the game. Do not go around the map alone because you will die easily. Do not play super aggressive in team fights. Just kite and automatic attack the nearest enemy champion. If you walk too far forward, the enemy will concentrate and down you. Continue kiteing in team fights and systematically adapt your positioning."}
{"text": "At the end of the game, look for choices on immobile or poorly positioned enemies. Taking someone at the end of the game can give you enough time to force a fight, sit a goal or take the Baron or the Elder Dragon. If the enemy is in a group, watch to group with your team too. In team fights, focus on the most squishi and the easiest to kill high priority targets in the backline. Flank in the team fights to get up on the enemy backline quickly. Make sure you are close to your team at any time so you can get in the quick fight."}
{"text": "Constantly adapt your positioning in lane so Ornn is unable to knock you up with his E. Stand away from walls and his Pillar Q so he is unable to CC.\n\nRefrain from using any major CC abilities on Ornn when his W is off cooldown as he can use it to dodge or escape CC.\n\nOnce Ornn hits level 6, his kill pressure in lane will increase and he may start getting ganks from his Jungler. Get vision in the river so you can spot the Jungler early."}
{"text": "Nautilus is strong early thanks to the amount of CC he has in his kit. But, he can be really weak if he is in a bad matchup.\n\nAt level 6, Nautilus has great gank set up and can go for kills in his lane or in others. If you can\u2019t set up your Jungler, look to roam mid and help your Mid Laner.\n\nWhen Nautilus has completed his first component item, his trading power in lane increases dramatically. He will be tankier too so his survivability will increase as well.\n"}
{"text": "If possible, avoid regrouping. Use your strong duel potential in the middle of the game to fight and duel all those who try to prevent you from dividing. Although you are a very strong division pusher in the middle of the game, be ready to team up with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no goals to be taken nearby."}
{"text": "As Teemo is a ranged champion, expect him to try and harass you as much as possible. Investing in defensive starting items could be a good way of dealing with him from the get-go.\n\nTeemo will place Shrooms t around the edges of the lane. Avoid walking to the side of the lane and only walk the path your minions take to reduce your damage taken.\n\nBe prepared to sacrifice some CS for XP and health. Teemo has a lot of kill pressure if he takes Ignite and is able to harass and poke you down."}
{"text": "By getting 3 points in his Ultimate e, he will use the ability quite often. Team fights will be a breeze for him from now on. His ability to make team fights unfair due to his selection potential will be quite obvious during this game phase. He only has Ultimate and his enemy out of sight. His tankness will not know any limits during this phase of the game."}
{"text": "At level 13, Corki maximizes his second ability which is usually his n. It is a very powerful peak for Corki as it will allow him to shred tanks in the end-of-game team fights. At level 16, Corki will put the third and final point in his Ultimate e. As the teams will regroup at this stage of the game, he will be able to bring them down a lot before starting a fight. Corki is very good in the late game as long as he is not late. Try and avoid falling behind in the early game to make you an overwhelming force to count in the late game."}
{"text": "He is frail pre-six because he has no way to gap close and get close to his enemies. He should powerfarm as much as possible.\n\nHis strength skyrockets post-six as he can gank the enemy reliably. He should focus on lanes where his allies have some form of hard CC or where the enemy is too pushed up.\n\nThe first item component will increase his clear speeds and let him deal a lot of damage in a very brief amount of time. This is quite helpful when ganking.        "}
{"text": "She can also use it again if the marked target dies. Try and divide slightly so that Vex can not handle a lot of AOE damage with her Q and E. Get rid of Vex, with poke before launching a fight could be very beneficial as she will miss on the shield to protect herself with. Her damage output will also be reduced."}
{"text": "Heavy power spike at level two which allows him to run an enemy down with his E, Q combo. This combined with his Passive and Summoner Spells may easily get him a kill on a squishy target.\n\nReally good wave clear with his W, Q and Ultimate R. This causes him to gain priority really fast and it also helps him secure objectives with his Jungler.\n\nPost-six, he can practically one shot an enemy with his combo while simultaneously re-positioning with his E. His E also makes him quite slippery, which allows him to evade ganks with ease."}
{"text": "You will be able to blow up the squishes with your Ultimate e with ease now. Even if they do not die, they will be too big to participate in a team fight. You will be able to burn through the entire enemy team with an appropriate positioning. Your 1 combined with your n will be able to shoot enemy squishes. Use this strategy during neutral and objective battles. Remember that your placement can make or break an entire team. Place it well and fog of war so that the enemy team does not anticipate it and take the necessary precautions in advance."}
{"text": "Camille can't really start trading too well up to level 4. Once she unlocked all her abilities and has several points in her Q, she can start trading. Camille next peak of power in the track is when she unlocks her Ultimate R. He offers her a lot of pressure to kill and is good to set up her Jungler. If you can't make use of her in your own way, you could wander with her to help your allies. Once Camille has finished her first component, her ability to trade with the enemy will intensify."}
{"text": "Use your Q to poke down Heimerdinger's turrets and reduce his pushing power. By removing his turrets, you limit his ability to control the lane.\n\nYour main objective is to stay healthy and keep your ADC alive. Focus on providing sustain and utility to your ADC rather than engaging in extended trades with Heimerdinger.\n\nSince Heimerdinger will likely push the wave towards your tower, assist your ADC in farming by actively participating in last-hitting minions.\n\nIf you want your jungler to help you in this matchup, it's crucial to avoid falling behind and losing too much health. Prioritize staying safe and avoiding unnecessary damage."}
{"text": "Teams tend to group up during the late game. This means that Lissandra will have a gala time finding picks and CC'ing the entire enemy team.\n\nHer Ultimate R will become really powerful when it is maxed out. This means that she will be able to pick off enemies with ease and whenever she wants to. This is really beneficial for her team.\n\nLissandra will have multiple items during this phase of the game. This means that she will be dealing tremendous amounts of AoE damage which will be detrimental to the enemy team."}
{"text": "When there is no team fight, look to divide the thrust and try to fight the enemy who is trying to stop you. Darius is a strong 1v1 champion and can fight most of the sledgers who are put up against him. Look to use your Ultimate e at the last possible second of each fight. Resetting to your Ultimate e will increase your chances of winning the fight. When you fight team, look to peel out and focus the nearest enemy champion. You are Darius, not a murderer and you will fight to kill anyone alone."}
{"text": "Try to stay with your support throughout the middle of the game. You are very vulnerable and easy to kill if you are alone. Staying with your support will increase your survival. Keep picking up the farm in the side lanes when there are no team fights, but spend as little time away from your team. You need gold and XP to buy items and if you fall behind, it will be unlikely that you will be able to eliminate the damage in the fights. Look for choices with your support/Jungler to get murders and increase your lead. If you kill a key target, you could make the call for Baron."}
{"text": "Extremely useful in team fighting due to its Ultimate R CC and damage. This allows her team to play around her and her Jungler for gank her. She has tons of poke in the track and can easily intimidate the enemy with her Q and E. Her Ultimate R is incredibly powerful for a Support."}
{"text": "His potential for engagement and locking is really high due to his E and Q. Once he unlocks his Ultimate R, he can move the enemy champions to disadvantageous positions and have them killed instantly. If he goes full AP, his burst damage is unreal, especially when he fights 1 v 1 against someone from squishier. His W still provides him with enough tankness to not get blown up immediately."}
{"text": "The damage must be unbearable for the enemy team and you will be able to get killed easily. Your W is extremely important in this matchup so make sure you use it with extreme discretion. The goal is to make sure that you surround the card properly before using the ability. After six, you should have an easy time getting the people of you in the game. It can also be used as an end move after you have loaded your E on the enemy."}
{"text": "During this phase of the game, make sure you get choices all around the map. Doing unfair team fighting should be your only goal. In team fighting, try to separate the enemy front line from the enemy rear line. This will allow your aircraft carriers to play freely, and you will be able to absorb a lot of damage for your allies. Use the fog of war and choking points to secure team fighting victories. Your chances of winning a fight will increase considerably as you have a lot of AoE effects in your abilities."}
{"text": "The first element will allow him to inflict more damage and spam his abilities due to the increased mana. Level six is a massive peak due to his ability to get his Ultimate R. This will allow him to play around the card and get his team before. He is really a great starter champion that his damage bursting during the start of the game is phenomenal. Anyone who is still will have problems with him."}
{"text": "Thresh will be looking for picks with his Q to start the team fight. Make sure no one on your team is out of position or too far forward as it may allow the enemy to start the team fight.\n\nIf Thresh misses his Q in a team fight, collapse on him and take him down. Thresh is really immobile and you should try to abuse him when he makes a mistake.\n\nAs Thresh will often go to ward alone, you could look to ambush him when he goes to place a ward. Taking him down early will leave his backline vulnerable to attack. You could also use the numbers advantage to take the Baron or Dragon."}
{"text": "Rumble is excellent during the end-of-game fights that its Ultimate b and its basic capabilities will all hit like a truck now, especially during the team fights. Maxing its Ultimate b will reduce the cooldown of the ability and allow it to use it frequently. This will be a decisive factor during the objective fights. Rumble will dry up a lot of damage during this phase of the game. Its ability to melt through the enemy health bars will force its enemies to play defensively."}
{"text": "It will have a lot of passive piles during this phase of the game. This scale is infinite, which means that Veigar can about a full-health squishy target shot. His n will be on a very short cooldown during this point in the game. He will be able to secure a lot of choices, especially around choking points. Once his ultimate R is maximized, he will execute the enemies with ease. Any enemy who gets hit by his e will be in Veigar's Ultimate R tuture range."}
{"text": "Avoid grouping too closely if the enemy has several knock-ups as this will allow Yasuo to get a very good Ultimate Roff. The grouping but not standing on each other will reduce the effectiveness of his Ultimate R.

CC is your best friend in team fighting."}

Keep them warded to spot them before they can secure the objective.\n\nPost 6, avoid fighting them at all costs as they are much stronger than you with their Ultimate and they will easily kill you.\n\nHe will be ganking a lot early on. Make sure you apply as much pressure as you can to match his early ganks."}
{"text": "If Tristana uses her W aggressively, burst her down or CC her so she is unable to reposition and clean up the fight. Taking her down early will make it really difficult for her team to win the fight.\n\nIn the mid-game, if Tristana is ahead, avoid walking too far forward if you\u2019re alone. She has great all-in and pick thanks to her W and E. Keep at an appropriate distance away from her so she cannot easily take you down.\n\nTristana has a lot of self peel with her W and Ultimate R.

His Passive allows him to relentlessly divide the thrust. This can be extremely useful when the Jax-S team is behind and cannot win a fair team fight. His e allows him to escape attempts of collapse with ease."}

She will need to whittle her target down before that, or she can rely on a gank or her Support.\n\nHer E tower damage allows her to procure plates and destroy towers with ease.

As your Q has high cooling in the first levels, make sure you don't put yourself in danger while it's on cooldown because it's your main damaging ability. Once it's down, play safer and try not to trade with Akali because you will have no damage. The best time to fight Akali is when it's low on energy."}

Don't walk too far in setting a goal as Sett can use his Ultimate R to take the closest champion and throw them into their allies behind them. If you are grouped together and online with each other, it will be harder for him to do it. When there is no team fight, Sett will set himself in a side lane and try to divide the thrust. When he is alone, you could look for him or start a team fight with his allies when he is unable to help them."}

His mid-game is not as weak as his first game because he will have his basics and can use his Passive quite well. He will also be part of many objective fights, allowing him to land a multi-man e stun on the enemies. Once he gets two points in his Ultimate t, he will become powerful during the team fights. That's because his survival will increase, which will increase the amount of constant damage he has suffered with his automatic attacks."}

{"text": "At the end of the game, look for choices about the immobile or mispositioned enemies. Taking someone at the end of the game can give you enough time to force a fight, sit a goal or take the Baron or the Elder Dragon. If the enemy is in a group, watch to group with your team too. In the team fights, keep focusing the most squishi and the easiest to kill high priority targets in the backline. Flank in the team fights to get on the enemy backline easily.

This allows you to play safely, chip on your enemy's health bar, and then all-in them with your Q empowered auto-attacks.\n\nThe amount of utility you bring to a team comp is massive. Your auto-attack slows and your Ultimate w CC can easily help your team secure picks before important objective fights. It also helps you increase CC chains on enemies.\n\nOnce you get two to three items, you can start slowing and shredding multiple members of the enemy team in close-quarter fights. This gives you a greater time to kite out enemies during skirmishes and keeps you safe from their CC while your team piles on them."}

Fight close to the bottlenecks to maximize the effectiveness of your combat team. Sometimes it would be wise to throw you into the enemy team, especially if the enemy front line decides to all-in-one without any follow-up.

His ultimate positioning R can have him killed if his team does not follow him. Moreover, going too deep without any help can also have him killed.

{"text": "Once you have access to all your basic capabilities, you can start trading more efficiently with the enemy. At level 3, you can look for more aggressive coins, but don't engage on them, so you don't fall back. At level 6, Akali can look for aggressive all-ins as his Ultimate offers him a lot of pressure to kill extra. Look for killers with your Ultimate when the enemy overextends."}

If it quickly spawns, make sure to place the vision around the lens as quickly and safely as possible before withdrawing to safety. Having the vision around the major goals is the key. Look for choices during the middle of the game. If you can choose someone with the help of your allies, you can abuse their death timer to win more gold and eventually take a turn, goal or get more dead."}

{"text": "The Ryze laning phase is when it is at its weakest. Avoid trading with it too much in the game very early that he will just want to remember early and get his Tear anyway. When Ryze reaches level 6, his death pressure does not increase because his Ultimate R is not a harmful tool. For most champions, your level 6 will be stronger than his. Try to fight as often as possible. Ryze needs time on scale, so delaying his ability to scale is the key."}

The Ultimate e in itself will be handy, though, and Tryndamere can use the lane brushes to catch the enemy by surprise.\n\nTryndamere is really good at split pushing due to his kit. It allows him to 1 v 1 targets with ease while also ensuring that he can escape in time should the enemy team decide to collapse on him.\n\nHe can pretty much duel any enemy during this stage of the game. This is quite a boon as he can make multiple enemies come to him while his team gets objectives."}
{"text": "His ultimate R does not really give him any form of power peak. His overall game style remains the same, and he can be easily removed if he overextends. Very dependent on the mana, so if someone manages to steal his Blue Buff, he will have a really difficult time to spam his abilities and kill someone.

{"text": "Once Gragas succeeds in reaching level 11, it will have two points in its ultimate R. This means that it can launch battles and move key enemy targets much more frequently. At level 9, Gragas will have its first maximum ability. This is really beneficial to it because the increase in damage will really help it to duel. It is especially true if Gragas goes for the complete AP construction. During the middle of the game, the enemy will be busy exchanging tracks and defining the vision. Therefore, as Support, Gragas should work with the Jungler to invade the enemy Jungle and kill such targets."}

This will also make it harder for her to get a good R Ultimate as she has to close the gap in order to stun you. Stand outside the minion wave at any time if possible. This will make it harder for Neeko to push you and poke you at the same time with her Q. Once Neeko has its Ultimate R, her death pressure will increase.

Due to it having several constructions, the efficiency of Garens can vary from one game to the next.

{"text": "Cho-Gath can easily get kited by ADCs and champions with dashes in team fights. This makes it difficult for him to catch the mobile champions. If Cho-Gath decides to use his Ultimate t on a minion, he has to wait a long time for him to come back. When he is on the cooldown as well, he lacks on many real potential damage. Cho-Gath is pretty weak in the way depending on the match he is in. He is really weak against the champions with strong early matches."}
{"text": "Her lack of escape tool makes her vulnerable to ganks, all-in and a lot of damage. This makes her more difficult to survive in the way. He relies heavily on her mana pool in early play to inflict damage. Although she can self-attack for an extra poke. This champion is quite motionless and is subject to CC. If they get caught by a CC, they will probably die. In particular, when she channels her Ultimate e she is vulnerable."}
{"text": "At the end of the game, look for choices on immobile or misplaced enemies. Taking someone at the end of the game can give you enough time to force a fight, sit a goal or take the Baron or the Elder Dragon. If the enemy is in a group, watch to group with your team as well. In team fights, continue to focus on the most squishiest targets and easier to kill high priority in the backline. Flank in team fights to get the enemy backline up easily.

He can\u2019t cast E on the same target twice, so he can easily be caught out.\n\nAlthough a power house, he is very squishy and can easily be burst down if he happens to mis-step.

As games end around or before the 30-minute mark, his late-game carry potential is lessened."}
{"text": "A maximum-out Ultimate R will help S\u00e9raphine a lot during the team fights. It can dry up a lot of damage, and the CC will allow her team to collapse on the enemy quickly. It should be really great as she will get all her items from here now. She will have to take care of her combat positioning to make sure she is not picked up. All her important items will be completed now, and she will be able to dry a lot of damage in very short jobs. She will also provide a lot of peeling and healing for her teammates."}
{"text": "The first element will allow him to inflict tons of damage to his opponent, and the trading will eventually become more accessible to him. Regular exchanges allow Pyke to easily win the track. Level six is a massive power peak as he can now execute champions with his Ultimate R. This means that he can quickly kill his laner or any other squishy with a rotation of his spells and his Ultimate R. Pyke is a worthy champion of the beginning of the game. He can blow up enemies, can wander relentlessly, and secure peaks all over the map. He will allow him to capitalize and get out over his enemies."}

Stand in the middle of the track as much as possible. At level 6 Camille will have access to her Ultimate R which can be deadly if you are low and overheard. Respect her all-in and do not push without vision as her Ultimate R can also be used to install her Jungler."}
{"text": "During the laning phase, it is very easy to abuse and get high. It is best chosen in tank champions. If Shaco is behind, it will be very difficult for him to get back in the game.

You must avoid being super obvious with your coins, especially with your Ultimate l otherwise, you will not fool anyone."}

Play safe for the first levels while you land poke on the enemy with your d. Once they are low enough, you can commit to an all-in-one. Once you hit level 6 and bought key elements, look to constantly harass and push the enemy in their turn. This will allow you to win turret plateau and increase your gold income."}

This will kill most of his enemies if they happen to get CC'd by Ryze."}
{"text": "Hecarim's h will be maximized once it reaches level 9, which will allow it to eliminate a lot of constant damage when it is in the middle of the enemy team.

This means that it can use it frequently, which translates into deader enemies wears."}
{"text": "Level 9 will have its first capability maximized. This will result in a massive increase in damage and will immediately make it a high priority target for the enemy. Its kit is superb during the team fights. It can immediately turn the tide of a battle with a well-positioned Ultimate R and help its allies to achieve crucial goals during this phase. Level 11 will be another peak for Qiyana, this time in increasing damage and reduced cooling."}

Be aware of this power peak and inform the one who tries to join her in the side track. At level 13 most Illaoi's will have their Tentacle Slam Q and Test of Spirit E maxed.

Darius is a starting champion in the middle of the game and once he arrives at the later stages of the game, his strengths become weaknesses. His Ultimate e is crucial in team fights to remove key targets. If he misses his Ultimate e, his release of damage will be greatly reduced and he could cost him the team fight.

Thanks to his cooldowns and the general state of the game, during the middle of the game, he will be able to assassinate and get choices on weak-health enemies as they walk around Rift Summoners alone."}
{"text": "Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map to reduce its all-in-one potential and limit its use of its E and Ultimate. Invest in early armor or magic pen to help you go against it.

Missing its E will put it in a vulnerable place, especially if it is laning on its own or when it is pushed upwards. This error can easily cause it to kill. It is very effective when fighting in closed spaces like the Jungle. The enemy can reduce this by fighting in the tracks and then matching its thrust if he tries to divide the thrust."}

In a 2v2 frame, his Ultimate R cannot be super valuable compared to other Supports. He does not do much damage like other Supports, and it can be difficult to use in the battle mix."}
{"text": "Use your Q for poke frequently Nasus in this matchup. This will help you reduce his stacking mechanic and allow you to get him down more easily. When possible, try to engage on Nasus when his W is on the cooldown. This will reduce his ability to slow you down, allowing you to inflict more damage and increase your chances of getting him down. Your ultimate can be a key tool in this matchup. Consider using it to interrupt Nasus's ultimate and disrupt his damage output. This can be a pivotal moment in the fight and help turn him in your favor. Building armor items is important in this matchup. It will help you reduce the amount of damage Nasus can do to you with his physical damage, increasing your chances of surviving and engaging team fighting. This will also allow you to control the pace of the game more easily."}

Make sure to adjust your positioning to the place where Heimerdinger is standing in the track.

It can let him pick off the enemy backline should he decide to go for the full AP build. His main prowess will come during team fights, though, where he can separate the enemy carries and kill them.\n\nGragas' first item will give him a massive damage boost in the lane. However, it honestly depends on the build he is going for as well. If Gragas goes for the tank build, he will be surviving for much longer during team fights due to his first item while dealing reduced damage. Either way, he will be of significant importance to the team."}

In the team fights, it could be difficult for him to kill anyone if they have CC, long-ranged poke, or disengage tools. He has the same problem as many assassins."}

You can use this to your snowball advantage and get more killers like Akali is a powerful killer and can kill squishy champions easily.

This is especially true if Jayce hides in the fog of the war and manages to break up an enemy unsuspectingly with his combo w > s. Jayce's poke is directly proportional to the number of items and components he has at the time."}

Therefore, Hecarim should use the fog of the Jungle war to his advantage during the team combat trial.

He has a short cooling time so he can play aggressively again and again. Once Fizz has recalled and picked up his first article, he will be able to drop out of a lot of damage quite quickly. A good Fizz will not be afraid to go for aggressive parts especially if he has a better first article than his opponent of the track."}

Resetting to your Ultimate e will increase your chances of winning the fight. When you fight team, look to peel out and focus the nearest enemy champion. You are Darius, not a murderer and you will fight to kill anyone alone."}

This will certainly allow him to increase his overall bursting damage, however. Once he will maximize his s at level 9, he will be able to extinguish a lot of damage. This is especially true if Jayce hides in the fog of the war and manages to break up an enemy unsuspectingly with his combo w > s. This can also be done from the track brushes if the enemy does not protect them. Jayce's poke is directly proportional to the number of items and components he has at the time."}

The first component will allow it to spam the abilities and flatten a lot of damage to its enemies. It will be incredibly beneficial during the laning phase. Taliyah is relatively weak during early play because its track is shorter and can be easily wasted. Its Q reduces the track space where it can use the ability freely."}

Be careful and make sure to play defensively, as it can burst both you and your ADC if you are taken in a favorable position. To create opportunities for your gank jungler, try to keep the minion wave closer to your turret. This forces Miss Fortune to stretch if she wants to harass or farm, making her vulnerable to gonks. Coordinate with your jungler and communicate the wave position to increase the chances of a successful gank. Timing is crucial in the way.

This can also allow him to all-in enemies once they are low enough after taking the barrage of poke Ezreal has to offer.\n\nHis Ultimate R has a very short cooldown and can be used freely during the early game to waveclear. This is very helpful when he is trying to clear the wave quickly in order to get a recall.\n\nEzreal\u2019s E allows him to get out of sticky situations with ease and makes him one of the safest ADCs in the game.

As he can do a considerable amount of damage and as he is an execution- he will be able to remove targets and use reset to kill several targets. At this stage of the game, Darius should be almost max build. As he builds items that increase his damage and offer protection, he will be relatively tanky and difficult to remove."}

He will also have access to the lane brushes, which will provide him with the element of surprise, and the enemy will have to play with a constant fear of being all-in'd."}
{"text": "Pyke is strong at level 1 and 2. Ensure you hit level 2 at the same time or before him to reduce his ability to get an early kill.\n\nOnce Pyke hits level 6, his kill pressure increases as his Ultimate R is an execute. Back away when low so he is unable to kill you and snowball his lead.\n\nPyke is really good at roaming. Once he has Mobi Boots, expect him to roam around the map and assist his allies. Ping whenever he goes missing."}
{"text": "Play safe for the first few levels. You need time to come online and you shouldn\u2019t be fighting unless you have a clear early advantage.\n\nConstantly push and poke the enemy with your abilities. Once they\u2019re low, you can look for an aggressive all-in. However, while kills are nice, your goal is to poke and not commit to fights.\n\nAfter destroying the bottom lane tower, rotate to the mid lane and try to take that tower. This will open up the map and give your team a gold lead."}
{"text": "In the later parts of the game, stay with your team and look for picks. Avoid separating or being too far from them as the enemy can force a fight while you are nowhere near. Play around your ultimate R and avoid committing to fight while it is on cooldown. If you fight while it is on cooldown, you will miss a lot of additional healing and damage, which can make the difference in a late team fight. In team fights, flank the enemy to make it easier to access the enemy rear line. Positioning away from your team but close enough to join the fight could give the enemy a false sense of security, making it seem that the fight is 4v5: forcing them to expand."}
{"text": "Darius is really strong once he has time to apply multiple stacks of his Passive onto an enemy champion. Do not let him do this by staying out of melee range and avoiding extended trades.\n \nDarius is very strong at level 6 as his Ultimate e is an execute. Recall if you\u2019re low at level 5 in case he gets the level up and tries to kill you. \n \nDarius has a very strong level 2 all-in. Take extra care when trading with him at level 1, and definitely do not fight him at level 2 as he will beat you."}
{"text": "Level 11 is not a massive peak of power because it provides it with nothing but a lower cooling. It will allow it to get a lot of backdrops. Its first capacity will be maximized to level 9. This will allow it to flatten a lot of damage during the duels that will be advantageous against the squishy targets. Its team combat potential is really high because it can do a lot of damage based on the AoE. Its C and E should come in very practical."}
{"text": "Abusing his weak early play to gain an advantage. After getting an upgrade, stand out of the wave to reduce his poke and wave thrust power. Bait his CC tool before entering for a trade or all-in. Be prepared to sacrifice CS for XP to stay safe and level in the way."}
{"text": "The second point in its Ultimate k will give it another peak. It can run enemies frequently now that the cooldown of the ability will be reduced. Olaf will have its basic elements during this phase of the game. It will increase its damage and survivals in the game, which will make it really good during the middle of the game. Its overall damage will be really high during this phase of the game. Its tankness and Passive will make sure that it kills enemies with ease, especially those taken out of position."}
{"text": "Level six is a massive peak for him and his team. It can now affect the fights easily with its Ultimate b and make sure that the enemies cannot fight him just and square during the fights. The first element will allow him to do a lot of damage to his opponents. It will also be beneficial when he throws his Ultimate b. His early play is good, but the result of the way really depends on the confrontation in which he is. It should have a fairly easy time in the way as long as he can poke enemies systematically."}

Watch your positioning, dodge Lissandra's damage and don\u2019t let them abuse you for free.\n\nYou\u2019re weaker than them whenever they have their Ultimate up. If you\u2019re at risk of dying, always recall at level 5 so you do not get killed when they hit level 6.\n\nJust let Lissandra push you into your tower. She has a lot of counter play potential, so just let her push and wait for ganks.\n"}
{"text": "Nasus' level 6 is a significant power spike as he can actually properly duel with enemies now. It will give him a massive advantage when dealing with enemy laners who are pushed up and run down by him.\n\nNasus is very weak early on and can be bullied hard due to the lack of HP and stacks on his Q. His main goal will be to farm and stack up to decimate the opposition during the later parts of the game.\n\nNasus' first item will give him a damage and survivability boost in the lane. It will bring him one step closer to achieving his most potent form in the game, but he should still focus on farming and stacking up his Q."}
{"text": "Avoid fighting in tight neighborhoods like inside the jungle or around a goal. This will make its Ultimate R much less powerful. With that said, when the group tries not to get too grouped together so that it can't bounce its Ultimate R between several champions either. In the final stages of the game, Brand will go and watch alone goals. Use this to your advantage by setting up an ambush and shoot it down before a spawning goal. Brand will try to inflict a lot of damage and delay a team fight for as long as possible while brewing."}
{"text": "You have a lot of presence during the early game. Roam every opportunity you get, especially on pushed-up enemy targets, to get a lead.\n\nWarding will be an essential part of your playstyle during this phase of the game.

Only use your b if you\u2019re certain you\u2019re going to land it.\n\nBlitzcrank has strong roaming potential, but it\u2019s important that you do not leave your ADC alone if they\u2019re going to die. Communication is key when you wish to roam on Blitzcrank.\n\nSimilarly to his b cooldown, whenever Blitzcrank is low on mana, he has minimal threat as he will be unable to use his basic combo. Ensure you always have enough mana to use both your b and t at any given moment."}
{"text": "Rek-Sai is good for selecting players in the middle and at the end of the game. Avoid walking around Rift Summoners alone as she could just target you. CC or Rek-Sai burst down as soon as she engages with her E. This will make it incredibly difficult for her to cover the damage or escape after entering. Rek-Sai fights in 5v5 team fights, so try to force them instead of separating and playing alone. If all 5 of your allies are grouped, it will be harder for her to engage safely without dying."}
{"text": "Jayce is going to use his range advantage to poke down melee champions. Be prepared to sacrifice some CS for XP when necessary.\n\nWhile he does have tons of poke, he does have high mana costs. If you can, try and look to fight when he is low on mana as he can\u2019t do much of a combo when he\u2019s low.\n\nMake sure you\u2019re always behind the minion wave so the minions block his s damage. Do not stand directly behind them as his s is AOE."}
{"text": "Zac becomes really powerful during the middle of the game. That's because it can multiple CC targets and secure many choices with its capabilities. Level 11 is another peak of power as it increases the damage inflicted by Zac to grouped enemies. It also has lower cooling, which means that it can obviously all enemies. At level 9, it will have its first maximum ability. This means that it will either have a massive reach advantage for gank enemies, or it will do a lot of damage to enemies close to it."}
{"text": "At level 6, Seraphine will unlock her Ultimate R. This makes her more than one threat and she will be able to install her Jungler quite easily. Seraphine is good in the team fights thanks to her Ultimate R. Avoid regrouping closely so that she is unable to get a powerful Ultimate Roff. Once Seraphine has finished her first element, her Q damage will increase and her threat to kill."}
{"text": "His Q can be blocked by minions. If the enemy is positioned well throughout the laning phase, it will be very difficult for you to land this ability. Misuse of his E can lead her to many unpleasant situations that are potentially fatal to her. This is especially true if her opponent has a hard form of CC."}
{"text": "Level 3 is a massive spike as she has all her abilities at her disposal during this game phase. She can use them quite effectively if she uses the lane brushes.\n\nLevel 6 is a decent powerspike as Seraphine will get her Ultimate R and can now change the tide of a fight if the enemy team is stacked together or is standing in a line. It also helps during neutral, objective fights.\n\nThe first item component increases her damage and allows her to use her abilities a bit more frequently. She is still mana-hungry, so she will need to be careful about spamming spells."}
{"text": "At level 6, Teemo\u2019s pressure increases thanks to his Ultimate t giving him extra damage and the ability to place Mushrooms t all around the map. \n\nThe more ability haste Teemo buys, the more Shrooms t he can place around on the map. Try to take unorthodox pathing to prevent walking through them.\n\nNashor\u2019s Tooth is a core item for Teemo. It gives him lots of additional stats- which makes him more of a threat."}
{"text": "At level 9, Ashe will have her maximum y. It's an important peak of power for Ashe because she can use it to bring down the enemy before her team engages in a team fight. When Ashe reaches level 11, she will put a secondary point in her Ultimate w. Her Ultimate w will have a short cooldown and she will be able to look for choices frequently throughout the middle of the game. Ashe should have finished one or two articles during the middle of the game. This makes her a huge threat in team fights that her performance of damage in conjunction with her poke can be devastating to manage."}
{"text": "Zac can gank at level 2 or 3 depending on the ability that he went second. Expect to gank your way to level 3. Zac is really good in team fights because his kit has tons of CC. Try to disengage whenever he E.S.I. engages to make it harder for him to get a good knockup. Once Zac touches level 6 and unlocks his Ultimate R, his gank and kills the pressure increases."}
{"text": "Level 16 is a massive peak of power, which means that it can completely decimate the enemies that are identified. It will frequently have to find sides on the enemy to make sure that it can take the game and win quickly. Most of its capabilities will be maximized by then. Its overall damage and maintenance will be really high, and the enemy will have difficulty getting rid of it."}
{"text": "At level 16, Fiora will put the third and final point in her Ultimate R. As she will be grouped during this stage of the game, the large AOE heal will be very helpful for her and her team. \n\nFiora is very good in the late game and as long as she hasn\u2019t fallen behind previously, she should be really good at this stage of the game.\n\nA full-build Fiora is nothing to be messed with.

{"text": "Look to assassinate targets that are walking around Summoners Rift alone. Your champion is really good at blowing somebody up, so try your hardest to increase your lead by getting picks.\n\nIn team fights, look to flank and blow up the squishiest enemies.

As you\u2019re the Jungler, make sure you make the call for the objective when necessary."}
{"text": "Your Ultimate h will be on an extremely short cooling now. Use the war fog to get spikes on the enemy and kill them quickly. Once you've finished all-in-the-enemy, make sure you go back to your portages and protect them. This will result in your ADC dying because of assassins. Neutral objective fights will be your bread and butter in this game. Always use the war fog to get a multi-man knockup to make sure your team can win the game."}
{"text": "If you're not early, don't worry because you'll always be able to protect your ADC with your E. Annie is a great team combat champion and as the teams will regroup in the end of the game. This allows her to get a multi-person R. Although Annie has a lot of brilliant damage, she starts to fall in the end of the game as the squishy champions start building defensive objects."}
{"text": "Tryndamere is heavily reliant on his dash to initiate an all-in, combined with his slow. You really don't have to panic unless he manages to slow you, at which point you may use a lane brush and a minion to reposition.\n\nMake sure that you don't let him farm peacefully in this matchup, else, he will easily regenerate his health and you will be left helpless in this matchup.\n\nPost six, you may want to consider ganking other lanes when possible. Your chances of getting a kill significantly increases when this happens.\n\nKeep the wave somewhere close to your tower in this matchup. It will give you ample opportunities to bring the enemy under the risks of ganks from your Jungler/laners."}
{"text": "As you get your items, you should have a really easy time blowing enemies up with ease. Set some deep wards to facilitate long-ranged Qs on the enemy team.\n\nYour E and W will be really beneficial during actual fights as the Grievous Wounds and the slow should disrupt the enemy heavily. This will make your team win fights easily.\n\nA defensive item may help you a lot in this matchup, especially if you are going for an AP build. Just make sure that you don't stay too far away from your allies."}
{"text": "The junglers can camp it at this stage as well as it will no longer have any other form of escape, and its E has a very long cooling period. It takes enough time for its itemization to work. It also depends on the fact that it is very skillful to shoot hard and that it will have to place its Qs on the enemy to be effective. Bouffer its E won=t works too well if the enemy has some form of varied CC that it can use to follow on Ezreal after using its E. This obliges it to play a little more defensively, and it cannot push in the wave either, otherwise it can be crushed by the enemy."}
{"text": "His Ultimate c allows him to shred through the enemy team if they happen to be grouped closely together. This makes Twitch very good in choke points.\n\nHe can use his s to scout for his team.

In an extended trade, he can easily kill someone if he is able to auto-attack them for free."}

Depending on its construction path, it can either do a lot of damage, be incredibly tanky, or offer its team a lot of utility. Everything depends on its construction! This makes Jarvan incredibly versatile. Its Ultimate m is really good in team fighting because it can lock several enemy champions at once."}
{"text": "Keep them guarded so that you can see the enemy moving around the map and see them start the goal. Stay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so that you are not caught out. Being caught will lead your team to play 4v5. Do not keep alone unless you know where the enemy is. Peel for your allies as much as possible. Keep them alive as long as possible in the team fights is a must to win the game."}
{"text": "At level 16, Kayn will have his Ultimate R maxid completely. This will directly strengthen his ability to all enemies and kill them because of his bursting damage. Kayn will now have several objects. It is good for him, depending on his form. He can assassinate people if he goes for the blue shape, while he can act as a front line if he goes for the red shape. Depending on the shape and build, Kayn will be either a murder machine due to his bursting damage or a tanky and non-killable front line that will easily detach for his wagons."}
{"text": "Sett is great in extended trades thanks to his Q. As long as he can stick to an enemy champion, he should win 1v1 fights.\n\nHis Ultimate R allows him to both get tanks off his carries as well as deal a lot of damage to the enemy team if he manages to ult his target into them. This can change the tide of a team fight in an instant.\n\nHis Passive allows him to regenerate a lot of health so he can resort to short burst trades against enemy champions unlike other tanks. His W does deceptively high damage as well, while providing damage mitigation to him."}

Watch your positioning and disengage if you\u2019re low as his all-in combo deals a surprising amount of damage.\n\nIn the mid-game, Sett will be difficult to fight unless you\u2019re ahead or have assistance. Avoid fighting him and disengage if he runs at you and tries to fight you."}
{"text": "This also means that even if Mordekaiser shoots you with his E, he can't sue you very far and you won't lose as much health. Before using your t to kill Mordekaiser, silence him with your m to prevent him from protecting the damage with his W and possibly avoid death, prevent you from winning a pile of your passive t. Play around Mordekaiser, and only engage when he's down. Otherwise, you'll have problems trying to bypass him due to a lack of mobility in your kit, and get dragged into a fight you're running away from.

He can use it to instigate tower dives and soak tower shots, while if he happens to take a lot of damage and get dismounted, he can easily get Skaarl back.\n\nHis Ultimate R allows him to initiate a team fight with ease.

This will reduce Soraka\u2019s healing potential from her W and Ultimate R to help you win the team fight.\n\nAs Soraka will be positioned in the backline, it will be difficult for you to take her down fast. To make killing her easier, try to flank from the side rather than running directly towards her in a team fight.\n\nSoraka is unable to match split pushes during the mid-game. If you\u2019re able to, you could put yourself in a side lane and force her to contest your push. You could then all-in her while she is alone."}

If she ganks a way and you can't contest it, try to invade her jungle on the opposite side of the map or gank another way to equal her pressure. Gwen has a very good objective control and can solo the Dragon and Rift Herald frequently. Place the vision to spot it before she is able to take these goals alone."}

It will help him get quick kills if he manages to push and reach level 2 first.\n\nLevel six is a massive power spike as he can now execute champions with his Ultimate R. This means that he can quickly kill his laner or any other squishy with one rotation of his spells and his Ultimate R.\n\nBoots are a massive power spike that allows Pyke to roam around the map very quickly. He can easily help the mid-lane get ahead and come back to the bot lane in a jiffy.        "}

Do not send someone who is unable to beat him to prevent him from pushing. For his e to be effective, he will have to get as close as possible to the enemy in a team fight. With this in mind, Renekton will probably try to flank in a team fight rather than run towards you. Make sure that your flanks are monitored so that you can spot him before he has the chance to engage."}
{"text": "Senna Passive makes her ladder unlimited. It's good that Senna can easily move on to the team during the final stages of the game. Senna is excellent in the fights at the end of the game because of her passive, cured and damaged squishes. Her positioning will be very important, and she should aim to take battles that occur near the bottlenecks. She will now have several articles, which will make it easier for her to do the job at once. With enough passive wraiths, she will be able to deal with the tanks quickly as well."}
{"text": "Stay close to your team in the late match. You should not be too far from them otherwise the enemy can force a fight or catch your team out of position. Look for choices with your Ultimate R in late fights. If you can choose someone who walks too far forward, you can use the number advantage to start another team fight. Group with your team in the late match, but try to stay hidden. This will allow you to get choices or initiate once the enemy walks too far forward or gets close to your team."}

At level 3, you can look for more aggressive plays, but don\u2019t over commit to them, so you don\u2019t fall behind.\n\nAt level 6, Akali can look for aggressive all-ins as her Ultimate offers her a lot of additional kill pressure. Look for kills with your Ultimate when the enemy overextends."}

Its Ultimate R has a very short cooldown and can be used freely during early play to wave. This is very useful when it tries to clear the wave quickly in order to get a reminder. Ezreal=\"E allows it to exit sticky situations with ease and makes it one of the safest ADCs in the game. It can also buffer it in response to the CC capabilities that will allow it to avoid following CC if it manages to get the initial CC capability."}
{"text": "Malphite will have several elements during this stage of the game. This allows it to do a lot of damage (if it goes for AP) or absorb a lot of damage if it goes for the construction of the tank. At level 11, Malphite will have two points in its Ultimate h. This will reduce the cooling of the capacity and will allow Malphite to have more impact. It is perfect in team fighting because it can completely delimit the enemy due to the threat of its Ultimate h. Its capabilities will also allow it to bring additional effects and utility to a team fight."}

It will be really good for her as she will deal damage and be able to keep her allies alive for a lot longer.\n\n2 points in her Ultimate R at level 11 offers her extra pick potential at this stage of the game. As teams start to group up in the mid-game, she will be quite strong.\n\nPutting an additional point in her Ultimate R is great for Renata as teams start grouping during the mid-game. The reduced cooldown on this ability enables her to go for more picks in fights.\n"}

While an extra point in his Ultimate R will come in handy, it is not going to make or break him.\n\nAt level 13, Azir will max out both his W and his r. He should be a real terror at this stage of the game and he will be able to dish out a lot of damage in a short amount of time.\n\nPaired with his level 13 power spike and picking up more and more items, Azir\u2019s late game is very strong."}

{"text": "When Corki finished his first element, his clear wave and poke damage will increase sharply. He should not find it at all difficult to keep the enemy pushed in their turn once he finished it. At level 6, Corkis clear wave increases as his e can help him push the enemy in their turn. His e are also a good tool to blow up and push the wave simultaneously. He is not necessarily strong at levels 1-4, and he does not have the largest range of automatic attack. If you play a long-range ADC, with a melee/all-in support, try to abuse his early play."}

Twitch's s allows him to remain undetected, which lets him bypass vision during the early game.\n\nLevel 6 is a massive power spike for Twitch as it allows him to excel in significant fights. His ability to impact grouped-up fights will let him take over the early game with ease.\n\nTwitch's objective control is quite solid as he can bamboozle enemies with his s. It is effortless for him to make an enemy laner recall abruptly after a gank and then go for the objective with his teammates."}

You can prevent this by playing as a team and avoiding walking in non-paid areas if you don't know where he was."}

This allows her to shoot down any squishy target she manages to put her Q on, which makes it very difficult for the enemy squishies to push up in their tracks. Unlike her counterparts, Diana has integrated the tankness that allows her to do everything with her Q, t, and Ultimate R combo quite easily. It's very valuable trying to pull out a group of three or more champions, especially when the enemy team is not aware of your position. Maybe one of the best flankers in the game. She can pull out the enemy backline almost instantly during a team fight if she is left unchecked."}

Keep them warded so you can see the enemy move around the map and see them starting the objective.\n\nStay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so you do not get caught out. Getting caught out will result in your team having to play 4v5. Do not ward alone unless you know where the enemy is.\n\nPeel for your allies as much as possible. Keeping them alive for as long as possible in team fights is a must in order to win the game."}

{"text": "His ultimate R allows him both to get tanks from his carts and to inflict a lot of damage on the enemy team if he manages to ulterate his target on them. This can change the tide of a team fight in an instant. His passive allows him to regenerate a lot of health so that he can resort to short tracks against enemy champions unlike other tanks. His W makes such high misleading damage, while providing him with mitigation of damage."}
{"text": "Your burst damage is almost non-existent when your Ultimate R is down. You'll have to play safer and less aggressive while it's on the cooldown. You're weak against the long-range poke due. If you can't get into the enemy's reach, you won't be able to play aggressive. Whatever the extra speed of movement of your E offers, Annie has little or no escape form. If you're too extended without your E to protect yourself, you'll be an easy target."}
{"text": "Zac really has long periods of cooling on his engagement abilities. Therefore, he can really use them as a tool of engagement or escape only once in a fight. If you know that he is without these abilities- try to fight him. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the pre-6 card. This will make it harder to jump with his E and should increase your overall survival in the way. Zac has really good roaming potential."}

{"text": "The teams tend to regroup during the end of the game. This means that Lissandra will have a gala to find choices and CC'ing the entire enemy team. Her Ultimate R will become really powerful when it is maximized. This means that she will be able to take enemies with ease and whenever she wants. This is really beneficial to her team. Lissandra will have several articles during this phase of the game. This means that she will make huge amounts of AoE damage that will harm the enemy team."}

The more the game goes, the more likely her chances of bringing her team solo to victory. Level six is a massive point of early play as she can now look for aggressive all-ins on the enemy. It is effortless for Vayne of bamboozle laner enemy now because of its invisibility. She can even use it to avoid the ganks. The first element will certainly give Vayne a massive boost in the duel. She will have to use the track brushes to make sure she can compensate for her short range."}

Try to go for a short trade first to bait it out and then commit to a trade while it\u2019s on cooldown.\n \nEnsure there is always 1 minion between you and Braum at all times. This will make it impossible for him to land his Q and potentially stun you.\n \nWhenever you\u2019re looking to poke or harass Braum, make sure you\u2019re not close to his minions so he cannot W to them and jump on you and turn the exchange around."}

He is strong during the fights at the end of the game while his Q and Ultimate R will hit like a truck now. He will have to check the enemy's inventory for a QSS before he decides to do everything in a champion, however. His Q and E will be maximized and will make a lot of consistent DPS during this phase of the game. The Q will allow him to keep the wave in check as well."}
{"text": "Its roaming potential is unrivalled as it can almost always access another route faster than its counterpart, as well as exit from sticky situations using its E. The ability to maintain both its ADC and itself with its W, while obtaining more mana from the collection of its passive chimes allows it to stay on the track for a long time. Due to its liabilities, it can quickly pass between staying on the track and roaming. A good Ultimate R can help its team launch a fight and set up a combo, especially when Bard manages to follow its Ultimate with its Q. This ability can also be used to block neutral goals and disengage if necessary."}
{"text": "His first ability will be maximized to level 9. He should strengthen his survival and damage in the game, and he should be able to make more choices now.

Avoid dividing or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you're gone. Play around your Ultimate n in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate n is standing. Fighting without this will make the fights of the late game team much more difficult."}

Once Quinn has finished her first element, her death pressure increases. If you are behind, avoid fighting her at all costs because she will probably beat you in 1v1."}

If you\u2019re trying to go for an all in, make sure to fight when 1 ability is missing.\n \nOf course, Fiddlesticks biggest power spike is his level 6. You can counter it by having constant wards around your lane. If he goes missing post 6, ping your teammates."}

It not only makes her move faster, but it offers extra roaming potential which can assist her in helping her other laners.\n\nLevel 6 is a massive power spike because she can now heal up her entire team during team fights.

She should use the lane brushes to amplify this effect and make laning very difficult for her enemies."}
{"text": "Mordekaiser is quite immobile. If the enemy has lots of mobility or has dodge tools, it will be hard for him to catch up with the enemy.\n\nPre-6, if Mordekaiser misses his E, his ganks will fail.

Most of his abilities will be maximized during this phase of the game. This means a lot of damage to his end and he is extremely slippery during the fights. CC will be his worst enemy during this phase of the game."}

Fizz's main power peak is once he reaches level 6. His Ultimate R is an incredibly strong tool that can help him get killed easily. He has a short cooling time so he can play aggressively again and again. Once Fizz has recalled and picked up his first article, he will be able to drop out of a lot of damage quite quickly.

It's perfect for her team, especially because her abilities will almost always increase. She will offer a lot of utility during the game at the end of the game, especially in neutral and objective fights. Team fights will be really useful because of her d.

Late game team fights are often decided in neutral objective pits while taking a goal. Kennen Ultimate m will come very practical during this stage and will allow him to win the match of his team."}

As her Ultimate R is a CC tool, using it on a squishy target usually leads to murder."}
{"text": "Your goal in the early game is to play safely, pick up gold and XP and avoid dying to the enemy lantern. You are rather weak in the early game and need time to come online. Once you have several levels under your belt, you should look for favorable short jobs.

This will ensure safety and reduce your chances of dying in the way."}

{"text": "His Passive can be really obnoxious to deal with, especially when he is hiding in a brush and moving in and out while pelting his laner with his t and t.\n\nHe is the bane of ADC mains as his t quite literally makes them miss their auto-attacks. This can reduce the effectiveness of the carry for a while, which gives his team some time to engage/disengage freely.\n\nThe Ultimate t can act as a substitution for vision, as well as deal a lot of damage when kept in the right spots. This is especially useful when it comes to avoiding ganks."}

Be prepared to sacrifice some CS for XP to stay alive in lane.\n\nTake note on who Kalista has been paired with. In many cases, this will either be the Support or Jungler depending on the situation."}
{"text": "Azir will try to delay a team fight and shoot you down with his W as much as possible before his team starts. Do not let him shoot you down by starting the fight as soon as possible rather than delaying it. CC is your best friend to counter his engagement and Shurima Shuffle. If he enters, try and CC him as soon as possible to stop him and prevent him from pushing your team towards his. After his first back, Azir will push constantly. Try and choose champions who have the pressure to kill and can match his clear wave so that you don't lose your Tour early."}
{"text": "After your bot lane has moved to the top lane, rotate to the bot side of the map or somewhere else on the map so you can continue to farm and gain XP. \n\nWhen no team fights are occurring, go to a side lane and push. It\u2019s important that you continue to farm during the mid-game so you can get your items as quickly as possible. Do not just stay top if you can\u2019t get anything done.\n\nUse your mid-game power spike to look for aggressive plays and all-ins on enemies who try to stop you from split pushing or ones that are moving around the map alone."}
{"text": "Morgana is good at level 6 when she unlocks her Ultimate R. Until then, her death pressure is not the best, but it increases once that ability unlocked. Once Morgana has Zhonyas Hurglass, her survival in team fighting will increase. Try to fight her when her Zhonyas is down, she is unable to defend herself. Every time Morgana has her Blackshield E available, her protection increases considerably and it will be difficult for you to kill her or the CDA when she can block CC. Try to fight when this ability is down."}
{"text": "A fully maxed out Ultimate r will allow Master Yi to mow down the enemy team. This is highly beneficial when it comes to cleaning up late-game fights.\n\nHis damage will be massive during the late game. He can keep on all-in'ing enemies as his Ultimate r will be up quite frequently.\n\nHis team fighting is on another level during this phase of the game. This means that he will be the pivot for his team's success, and his e usage will determine the game's outcome."}
{"text": "Malphite is a strong Jungler, especially after reaching level 6 because he can easily inflate his allies with his Ultimate h. Malphite has a very versatile construction path. He can either go damage, damage or full tank, depending on what his team needs. Malphite is very good in team fighting because he can potentially land a five-person Ultimate h. Knocking several champions could win his team the fight."}
{"text": "2 points in his Ultimate r will make him more powerful during the fights. He will have to flank enemies and make sure that the entire CC on the side of the enemy teams is exhausted. His first ability will be maximized at level 9, which will allow him to inflict heavy amounts of damage in a very short period of time. He is decent enough during the team fights. He can completely decimate the enemy team if he manages to get an e reset off with his Ultimate r activated."}
{"text": "Swain's Ultimate R will be really powerful from level 11. It will be able to affect team fighting quickly, and its zoning potential will increase considerably to ensure that its backline remains safe at all times. Swain will have the opportunity to impact team fighting during the middle of the game, mainly neutral objective combat a lot. This is very beneficial to him, given the AoE aspect of his Ultimate R. Its first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will increase its burst damaged by many and it will be easier for him to secure peaks on isolated enemy targets."}
{"text": "Try to keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map early. She will not be able to use her E very much if she is pushed up.\n\nPost 6, beware of her strong burst and all-in potential with her Ultimate R. Try and stay far back from her if you\u2019re low.\n\nHer Q is blocked by minions and so is her W. Always stand inside or around the minion wave to make it hard for her to harass you.\n"}
{"text": "Group up with your team during this phase of the game and ensure that you can land consistent DPS on the enemies. Your Ultimate R should be saved for yourself, but exceptions are applicable if one of your carries is in danger.\n\nUse your W wisely during this phase of the game. That ability can completely change the outcome of a fight if you use it at a good moment. A proper moment would be to ruin a mage's full damage combo by W 'ing them.\n\nDuring neutral, objective fights, stay somewhere near your Jungler so that they don't get picked off during or before a fight. Losing crucial objectives will definitely lead to your loss if you're not careful enough."}
{"text": "Her Q can be blocked by minions. If the enemy is positioning well throughout the laning phase, it will be very hard for you to land this ability.\n\nMisuse of her E can lead her to many nasty situations which are potentially lethal for her. This is especially true if her opponent has some form of hard CC.\n\nMissing her Q can give her enemies a long time window to harass her freely. That ability is quite easy to dodge if she tries to land it from vision or from maximum range."}
{"text": "If Jarvan builds AD, he is going to be very squishy in team fights and will get blown up quickly in team fights. Once he\u2019s gone in, he will need to fully commit to the fight. \n\nTo ensure victory, you need to make sure your team is in a position to follow up. If you go in without them, you\u2019re going to die.\n\nPeel, disengage and CC are J4\u2019s biggest weaknesses. He will be unable to use his d and e combo effectively if the enemy can poke him down, reposition or CC him mid-combo."}
{"text": "You are really good at securing the goals in early play. Look to secure the goals whenever they are. Find a healthy balance between the glove of your allies, the agriculture of your jungle and safety goals. Make sure you don't fall behind in XP trying to gank constantly. Look several times at the gank tracks that are wider or Flashless. Your champion is very good at several times the glove tracks over and over again."}
{"text": "Group and stay with your team. Go to the hall when you know where the enemy is in order not to be chosen and killed before an objective spawning. Look for choices with your ultimate e. Leona can quickly force goals or team fights with ease if she can catch someone who walks too far forward. Peel and protect your allies as much as possible in mid-game team fights. If you let them die, it will be difficult for your team to win the fight. After engaging, retreat and peel for your ADC."}
{"text": "When playing as a melee champion, do not go for extended trades with Fizz as he will always come out ahead thanks to his W.\n\nUnless you benefit from any other wave manipulation, try and keep the wave even or closer to your side. This prevents him from engaging on you or chasing you down.\n\nFizz has insane roaming potential. Do not blindly follow him as he can easily turn around and kill you. Instead, communicate with your team while following him from a distance if possible."}
{"text": "Try to finish the game as fast as you can as long as the game goes, the stronger Kayle becomes. Kayle will tend to be split pushing during the middle of the game. You can use this time to force a team to fight with the advantage of numbers as she pushes into a side track. Kayle is rather vulnerable when her Ultimate R is on cooldown. Try to force the fights and kill her while her Ultimate R is on the ground."}
{"text": "You should look for early duels with Dr. Mundo, because your E will always give you a high hand in this matchup. Amplify the duel potential with an element of Wounds Grievous. Your Passive should allow you to detect Dr. Mundo with ease. This will be really useful when it comes to letting your teammates know where Dr. Mundo is. It will also allow you to keep the enemy jungle deep safely. You should have an easy time trying to spank the enemies with your E because it can allow you to catch them out of sight and shoot them down. Just make sure that Dr. Mundo is not nearby; otherwise, you cannot shoot the gank successfully. During team fighting, always try to target the enemy rear line and kill at least one enemy. It will also allow your team to deal with Dr. Mundo effectively if he decides to go solo."}
{"text": "Swain is good in team fights thanks to his AOE Ultimate R. Forcing a fight or fighting when Swain isn\u2019t around will make it easier for your team to win team fights.\n\nAvoid grouping to closely around objectives or in team fights as it may allow Swain to land a really good multi-person E and start the team fight.\n\nBurst and poke is the best way of winning a fight against Swain. Try to poke him down before a team fight starts. When he activates his Ultimate R, burst him down so he is unable to dish out lots of damage."}
{"text": "Its passive can cause chaos when it is used properly in a fight. This is especially true when it tries to flank the flanks as Jungler or when it tries to wander in another way after pushing its way. It is superbly strong when it comes to fighting in closed areas. It provides it with a complete use of its W as well as to do a lot of damage. Its effigies help it with the same and can be used to secure and erase a lot of vision for its team. For the side track, or while the track is gauntling, it can make full use of the track brushes for bamboo enemies. It can continue to hit the enemy team with its E and with good itemization, its E can do a lot of constant damage. Silence is also very valuable, especially against the enchanters."}
{"text": "Play safely in the game early. You need time to come online and if you fall behind, you'll have trouble in the line and you'll delay your first major power peak. Focus on electric farming and minimize trading up to your level 6. Once you unlock your Ultimate k, you can start to be more aggressive. Once you're level 6, you can look at playing more aggressive than you can use your Ultimate k as a trading tool and something to come back on."}
{"text": "Once level 6, Maokai is an excellent tool for throwing ganks. At level 3, Maokai can start playing more aggressively as it will have access to all its basic capabilities. Maokai is good in team fighting because its Ultimate R has a large effect zone. Make sure to separate or disengage as soon as you see it so it is unable to use this ability."}
{"text": "It has a lot of utility and damage in its kit that allows it to play around its team quite often. All it has to do is to get out of its laning phase without giving the enemy a huge lead. Its E gives it a lot of off-play potential if it is used correctly. Against unsuspected enemies, this skill can be really deadly, and can help it kill safely enough. Can flank the enemy team with a relative ease and can come out of sticky situations with its E. This can send the enemy team in full panic mode and can allow your team to follow with ease."}
{"text": "Lissandra's first element will allow her to break out more effectively. It is very beneficial for her team as she can wander around a large number. Lissandra will get a massive power peak at level 6 due to her ability to chain CC an enemy to forget. It is really useful when it comes to a fast or mobile transport. Putting several points in her Q will make her more powerful. It will allow her to get out quickly and allow her to do a lot of damage to enemy groups."}
{"text": "Level six is when Nocturne ends up becoming a global threat to the enemy team. It can easily wander around and get free murders. Its early game laning is quite strong. It can easily wave and get on enemies quickly. The first component will allow Nocturne to the enemy duel easily and inflict massive damage to the enemy team during the fighting."}
{"text": "Focus on securing the remaining Dragons/ Rift Herald in the mid-game. Getting as many Drakes as possible will increase your chances of winning the game.\n\nPeel for your team in team fights. After using your Ultimate R, peel for your allies to keep them alive.\n\nYou can flank and use your Ultimate R to catch out over extended targets and knock them into your team to start the fight. In particular, try to knock the enemy backline forwards into your team."}
{"text": "It is vulnerable when its t is down, and can be engaged if its speed of movement k is reduced. Its ultimate t can easily be rid by the enemy by buying Control Wards. Enemy Junglers with jumps and dashes can also bypass these mushrooms by taking strange routes. It falls quite drastically during the end of the game and can only resort to split thrust. This puts his team in a disadvantageous state and causes a lot of tension to accumulate within the team."}
{"text": "Your goal is to match its thrust power with your W. Stand outside the minion wave at all times so it can't push and poke you at the same time. This will be important if you want to survive the laning phase. Avoid using your Q too often in this matchup unless it's away from the minion wave. It costs a lot of mana and you need the mana for your W! One option you can take is to put early points in your E for the extra shield force."}
{"text": "Group and stay with your team. Go to ward when you know where the enemy is so you do not get picked off and killed before an objective spawns.\n\nLook for picks with your Ultimate e. Leona can quickly force objectives or team fights with ease if she can catch someone who walks too far forward.\n\nPeel and protect your allies as much as possible in mid-game team fights. If you let them die, it\u2019s going to be difficult for your team to win the fight. After engaging, retreat and peel for your ADC."}
{"text": "Harass the enemy throughout the laning phase with your Q. Your goal is to constantly harass the enemy whenever possible and get murders. After destroying the tower of the lower lane, turn to the middle track and try to take this tower. This will open the map and give your team a gold advance. Poke and harass the enemy Mid laner and force them away from the goal to make it easier to secure the tower of the medium track. Keep a constant eye on the minimap and your health of your allies. Use your ultimate R on the low allies who are able to turn and win the fight or survive. Avoid losing your ultimate R on the allies who will die even with your ultimate R."}
{"text": "His early play is excellent as he can completely CC and blow up an enemy target when necessary. Using the brush line will allow him to reap a lot of benefits. Level six is an excellent peak as he can now control the pace of a team struggle. He can easily be between the enemy team while treating a lot of health and regenerate a lot of health in return. The first element will allow him to spam his abilities frequently and deposit a lot of damage."}
{"text": "This champion is pretty immobile and is prone to CC. If they get caught out by any CC, they will probably die.\n\nLulu relies on her team to carry while she provides them with heals and shields.\n\nLulu is a squishy champion with low hit points. This makes her pretty vulnerable and easy to kill. Picking your fights and avoiding constant trading is key to winning."}
{"text": "His early play is rather weak, but killing him can be difficult. Expect him to focus on agriculture rather than fighting in the game very early. Zac is really good in team fights because his kit has tons of CC. Try to disengage whenever he E.S. in to make it harder for him to get a good knockup. Once Zac hits level 6 and unlocks his Ultimate R, his death pressure increases."}
{"text": "Just make sure that you land the last success on the minions so you get your health back! Its e has a very large reach. This makes it easier for it to land and the CC. The only problem is that it can be difficult for it to land against champions with dashes or escape tools. Cho=Gath is a strong scaler with a versatile construction trajectory. This means that it is great in the last stages of the game regardless of how before or behind it was in the first stages of the game."}
{"text": "Another point in his Ultimate e will allow him to dish out a lot of AoE burst damage and use the ability quite frequently.\n\nVladimir is perfect during mid-game fights. He should accumulate a lead during this phase of the game by bursting enemies down with his Q and Ultimate e.\n\nHe is terrific in team fights due to his Q , E, and Ultimate e. If the enemy is clumped up, Vladimir will decimate them with his Ultimate e.        "}
{"text": "The final point in his Ultimate n will allow him to deal tremendous amounts of damage to the enemies. He should try to look for flanks during team fights to maximize his Ultimate n usage.\n\nHe will have many items now, which will make him really tanky and will allow him to deal lots and lots of damage in a short amount of time. The enemy team will have a hard time dealing with him.\n\nWukong is pretty substantial during this phase of the game. Still, he will have a hard time killing them due to them purchasing defensive items. You will want to group up with your team as frequently as you can."}
{"text": "It is important to make sure that it cannot channel its capabilities. Avoid fighting it when its resource bar is half filled. Otherwise, it will cause you to take a lot of damage and you will be cut altogether a bit. Keeping your portages is of paramount importance so make sure to get it out of a fight as soon as possible. Keep the wave near your turn. The enemy does not have some kind of sifting potential and can easily be exposed to the ganks."}
{"text": "Flank in team fights to get on key targets with your E. Avoid showing you when possible in the end of the game that the element of surprise can provide a huge advantage. When in the future, look for peaks while waiting in high traffic areas for an enemy to pass. If you are able to descend the enemy Mid, ADC or Support, you can use their death timer to finish the game or take a major goal. Avoid dying and stay on the same side of the map as the next major goal. Do not show on the lower side of the map if Baron is about to climb."}
{"text": "Invest in healing reduction. It will reduce his sustainability.\n\nStand as far back as possible so he cannot land or use his Q on you.\n\nAim your abilities so they push and poke you at the same time.\n\nAt level 6, it can be hard to kill Swain. Only look for the all-in if your Jungler is nearby and ready to help."}
{"text": "In the Support role, she has great pick potential with her E and Ultimate. She can catch any enemy who overextends post 6.\n\nShe can constantly pick up kills in the lane with her Ultimate. If you can\u2019t get kills in lane, look to roam and help your allies instead.\n\nCamille can play aggressive from the get-go. She can get early kills, get picks and deal a lot of damage as the game goes along.\n"}
{"text": "At level 16, Fiddlesticks will put the third and final point in his Ultimate R. As long as he can get the channel off, he will be very good in the late game.\n\nTeams will continue to group in the late game. This will allow Fiddlesticks to get a lovely amount of damage down to the whole enemy team.\n\nWhile you\u2019re good in the late game, you\u2019re incredibly squishy. Lookout and be cautious when trying to get a good Ultimate R off so you don\u2019t get killed before a fight breaks out."}
{"text": "Zilean is super squishy. Focus him rather than the ADC enemy in the way to increase your chances of getting killed. Once Zilean is level 6, it will be harder for you to get killed in the way. Every time his Ultimate t is down, try to abuse him to get killed. One way to kill him when his Ultimate t is up is to lock him up with CC so he is unable to use it on himself."}
{"text": "Level six is a massive power spike as it unlocks Lux's 100 to 0 combo. Any enemy who gets caught out by her g will be in for a world of pain from now on.\n\nHer first item component will allow her to spam her abilities with a higher frequency, deal more damage, and assert lane dominance due to her long-range.\n\nHer early game isn't that luminous because her damage isn't too significant because of no items. As the game progresses, she should have an easy time dealing with her opponents.        "}
{"text": "At level 9, Ashe will have her y maxed. This is an important power spike for Ashe as she can use it to poke the enemy down before her team commits to a team fight.\n\nWhen Ashe hits level 11, she will put a secondary point in her Ultimate w. Her Ultimate w will have a short cooldown and she will be able to look for picks frequently throughout the mid-game.\n\nAshe should\u2019ve completed an item or two during the mid-game. This makes her a huge threat in team fights as her damage output in conjunction with her poke can be devastating to deal with."}
{"text": "Once it has several objects, it will crush the enemies to the left, right and center. All it has to do is to sit in the fog of the war and wait for an unsuspecting enemy to enter on it. At level 16, Lux goes mega-spike. This is due to its Ultimate n being reclassified to level three. It will now blow up the enemies with the Ultimate n alone, and the cooling of capacity will be negligible. Its g will be on a very low cooling now, and the Jungle will be its playground."}
{"text": "Cassiopeia is one of the most immobile champions of the game. Cassiopeia is therefore a target of choice for the ganks and teams with good diving potential. When against mobile champions like Talon, Lee Sin, Rengar, it will be really difficult for her to land her Q, make use of her W and escape a trade. She fights against enemies who move quickly."}
{"text": "Level 2 in the lower lane is the first wave of minions followed by the next 3 minons of melee. Your goal during the laning phase is to search for murders and abuse the enemy as often as you can. Try to play aggressive frequently to get an advance.

{"text": "Really good poke and wave clear with his Q. The slow also allows him set ganks for his Jungler and allows him to whittle his laner down.\n\nHis W can allow him to heal a lot of health in dire situations. Being a point and click, it is quite easy to land and can easily change the tide of a fight.\n\nThe initial cast of his E allows him to dash to a certain location. This can allow him to dodge skillshots and also get on an immobile or vulnerable carry."}
{"text": "Once Fiddlesticks has his Zhonya, it allows his R to really hit at home. If he channels his R and uses his Zhonya, you can't attack him when he goes into the stasis. When Fiddlesticks has access to 3 abilities, it's really hard to manage because they offer him so much utility. If you're trying to go for a whole in, make sure to fight when 1 ability is missing. Of course, Fiddlesticks' biggest power peak is his 6. You can counter him by having constant guards around your track. If he's going to miss position 6, ping your teammates."}
{"text": "In team fights, use your authorized E to get choices to start the fight. Catching someone and then getting a murder could provide your team enough time to take the Baron or Dragon. Peel for your team in team fights. Use your Q on the nearest champion to protect you and your ADC."}
{"text": "The Zacs E can be used from afar to start the team fight. Make sure to keep your flanks by sipping a goal. Avoid fighting in the jungle as it will be easier for Zac to land his E and hit your entire team with his Ultimate R. Fight in the open if possible. Do not regroup too closely. If you are slightly separated, it will be impossible for Zac to catch up and hit your entire team with his E and Ultimate R."}
