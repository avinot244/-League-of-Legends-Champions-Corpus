If you see her making towards your lane, ensure that you run through the middle of the lane to escape. Do not stand close to the walls.During the mid game is where Qiyana truly shines. This is because she is a great team fighter thanks to her R. Unlike many other Assassins, Qiyana actually favours team fighting 5v5. Do not group to close to the wall during this time as she may look to engage.Once Qiyana has her jungling item completed, she will be looking to duel and trade more frequently thanks to the extra damage and cooldown reduction it will provide. Unless you have a clear advantage, be cautious when heading into the 1v1."}

His Q > W > Q combo is already potent. That combined with his p will make him or his ADC nearly uncatchable.Getting his first item will increase Zilean's poke damage by a considerable margin.

But, avoid going for extended trades with him as he will usually win those due to his passive."}
{"text": "Once Akali has completed her first item, her kill pressure increases and so does her damage output. Respect her all-in pressure once she completes it. Akali is capable of all-inning squishy champions at level 6 as she gets tons of mobility and damage thanks to her Ultimate. If she hasn't been playing aggressive before level 6, expect her to do so once she gets the level up. Try not to give Akali kills in the early game. She is a snowball heavy champion and once she has some gold under her belt, she can easily take over the map."}

It will allow his Q and E to hit like a truck during all-ins.Once Galio hits level 6, he unlocks the ability to make cross-map plays around the map. This is advantageous for his team and will let you impact the game a lot more.Since Galio has limited range, he will have a hard time early during the game. However, he can use his Q to bypass this. When using his Q, he should try to hit the enemy champion for bonus points."}

It will let Shaco one-shot enemies if they destroy it while it is in their vicinity.He will be dealing a lot of damage to the enemy team now, especially the squishy targets. He has the potential to one-shot low health, immobile, and squishy targets quickly now.Shaco is pretty decent in team fights due to his clones and the short cooldowns on his abilities. He can quickly get rid of critical carries due to his e and set traps for the enemy team using his Ultimate l and x."}

This is especially true when he is trying to flank from the sidelines as a Jungler or when he is trying to roam to some other lane after pushing his lane in.He is superbly strong when it comes to fighting in closed areas. It provides him with complete usage of his W as well as deal a lot of damage. His effigies help him with the same and can be used to secure and clear a lot of vision for his team.For the side lane, or while lane ganking, he can make complete usage of the lane brushes to bamboozle enemies. He can keep poking the enemy team with his E and with the proper itemization, his E can do a lot of consistent damage. The silence is quite invaluable as well, especially against enchanters."}

This allows the enemy team to pick her off before a major fight or when her e is on cooldown.Too steep of a learning curve, which makes it very hard for new players to master this champion. Effectiveness is reduced if the player can\u2019t cancel Auto-attack animations.Very hard for her to come back into the game if she falls behind early on. Very useful for the enemy team to gank her when she is pushed up or dive her when her r is on cooldown."}

If you cannot end the game and it gets to late game, you are gonna find it difficult to win."}
{"text": "Putting the second point in Fiddlesticks Ultimate R at level 11 is very important for him. It will put his Ultimate R on a shorter cooldown and allow him to look for more aggressive plays.At this stage of the game, Fiddlesticks should\u2019ve completed an item or two. His damage output will be quite high which can allow him to win mid-game team fights.In the mid-game, teams start to group. This is good for Fiddlesticks as he benefits from teams grouping closely together as his Ultimate R is an AOE tool."}

This puts the additional task of making sure that you are positioned well during fights as one misstep can get you killed.The enemy team will look to gank you multiple times during the laning phase to set you back. Although it doesn't affect your utility, you won't be able to get enough items to impact fights later on which will cost your team multiple fights and objectives.Whenever your Ultimate w is down, you have little to no self peel. While your y does slow a target, it can be quite difficult to get them off you if you\u2019re alone and low."}

Try to fight when he\u2019s not there as it will make team fighting much easier. Also, setting him behind in the early game will make him less strong in team fights."}
{"text": "Trading against Heimerdinger can be extremely tedious, yet it can be done. Taking down his Turrets Q will be the main focus in order to poke or trade with him.When using your skills shots (if they\u2019re AOE), try and aim them so they hit both Heimerdinger and his Turrets Q.

For a squishy champion, he can one-man the Baron if he is ahead.His Ultimate r can completely shift the tide of a fight if he is left unchecked. This allows him to use his e frequently, which allows him to avoid CC. Combined with his Wuju Style, he deals a lot of damage."}

He can just dash in, auto an enemy twice, and then use his Ultimate t to finish them off.At level 13, Graves will be able to deal a lot of burst damage and play circles around the enemy due to his maxed out l and e. In addition, it will give him an excellent dueling advantage."}
{"text": "Just like in the mid-game, you should stick with your Support throughout the later parts of the game. Do not go around the map alone as you will die easily.Do not play super aggressive in team fights. Just kite and auto-attack the nearest enemy champion.

The lane brushes will help you a lot with this as well.His mid-game power spike is dependent on his team comp as well. Yasuo will be able to do a lot more in the game with ease if Yasuo's team has a form of knockup on any of their champions.

This is especially true if Jayce hides in the fog of war and manages to burst down an unsuspecting squishy enemy with his w > s combo.Jayce's poke is directly proportional to the number of items and components he has at that time. Due to his ranged stance, he can quickly go for short burst trades where Jayce is guaranteed to come out on top if he spaces well."}

This also means that even if Mordekaiser pulls you with his E, he can\u2019t chase you very far and you won't lose as much health.Before using your t to kill Mordekaiser, silence him with your m to prevent him from shielding the damage with his W and perhaps avoiding death, preventing you from gaining a stack of your t passive.Play around Mordekaiser\u2019s E, and only engage when it is down. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have problems trying to dodge it due to a lack of mobility in your kit, and get dragged back into a fight you were escaping.At level 6, Mordekaiser can force you into a fight with his R. Be prepared for this at any time that you\u2019re trading, since it can quickly become an all-in from Mordekaiser."}

If he miss-times his Ultimate e, his damage output will be reduced heavily and it may cost him the team fight. This is why he needs to cast his Ultimate e as soon as the enemy gets into health range."}

By standing outside of the wave, she\u2019ll be unable to poke and push the wave at the same time.Keep an eye on how many empowered stacks she has. If she has 3, play safer as her next ability will be much stronger.Once she hits level 6, expect her to either look for kills in lane or set up her Jungler for ganks. Her Ultimate R is a strong tool that offers her extra kill pressure."}

He can use it to soak up so much damage without the risk of dying, and he can quickly remount if Skaarl flees.Kled will have his build almost completed by now. This means that he will be tanky, as well as dish out heavy amounts of damage. Anyone who gets caught out by him will probably end up dying.Since all his abilities will be maxed at this point, Kled will be huge in the game. His ability to disrupt the enemy teams' ranks will be phenomenal, and he can easily peel for his carries as well."}

This means that he will be dealing a lot of damage to his enemies while simultaneously tanking a lot of damage. Any enemy who gets caught out by him will get chunked out and probably die.Renekton is decent in the mid-game, but he should focus on ending the game during this phase of the game itself.

This means that Yasuo will decimate the enemy due to his Passive and r damage. He can pretty much one-shot squishies with ease.Due to all his completed items, and his ability to quickly dash around and pierce through the tanks' armors, Yasuo will be able to deal a plethora of damage in a short time.

Because of this, your abilities will deal a lot more damage which will allow you to pick of squishy targets.At level 9, Zyra would\u2019ve maxed either her Q or her E.

Pushed-up enemies should be his prime target as they will let him get free kills. He should also be able to clear camps rather quickly from now on a respond to ganks quickly.Once Hecarim hits level 6, he can terrorize enemies with his flanking potential. It will allow Hecarim to completely isolate a target from their team and burst them down with the help of his team. His sustain will be pretty high as well (due to runes and life steal)."}

As a Jungler, Gragas will mostly be the latter, so his main goal will be to blow up the enemy backline when he gets the chance.His dash and Ultimate R make up for a significant amount of peel for his carries. Should he go for the tank build route, he will successfully absorb much damage for his team while his team follows up on Gragas' engagement."}

This is because he can easily blow enemies up with his w > s combo. Sometimes a single combo is all it takes to kill a target (like a squishy support, for instance). All he needs to do is sit in the enemy Jungle and wait for an unsuspecting enemy to come near.Jayce won't spike at level 16 either because his Ultimate G won't be providing with him a lot of raw stats, which other champions' ultimates offer them with.

In addition, the CC aspect will allow him to score many picks throughout the game.His mid-game is not as weak as his early game because he will have his core items and can use his Passive pretty well. He will also be a part of many objective fights, allowing him to land a multi-man E stun on the enemies. His E can also be used to make cheeky plays using the lane brushes and lack of vision.Once he gets two points in his Ultimate R, he will become mighty during team fights. This is because his survivability will increase, which will increase the amount of consistent damage dealt by him with his auto-attacks."}

Although a strong engage tool, his E is quite short-ranged and he definitely needs the fog of war to catch his enemy off-guard.While jungling during the early game, Gragas can be invaded early on when he is busy ganking. Doing so will force Gragas to show himself to lanes in order to soak experience as he won\u2019t have any camps to take due to him being invaded. On the other hand, if he is laning, just poking and consistently harassing Gragas will force him to recall abruptly."}

This is because the empowerments will be more powerful, and Heimerdinger will use them both offensively and defensively. In addition, it will let him harass the enemy laner relentlessly when they are trying to farm in the lane.Heimerdinger excels during team fights as he can control a large area with his Q turrets.

When he isn\u2019t with his team, you could force a team fight with the numbers advantage, but be aware that he can use his Ultimate R to join the fight quickly. Once Kled has been dismounted, make sure you finish him off quickly otherwise he may be able to remount again and take over the team fight."}

Then use your Ultimate R to take them down quickly before looking to siege or take a nearby objective.At this stage of the game, you should have tons of stacks and be really strong.

This is extremely beneficial when used from out of vision, or when enemies are near a wall.Provides a lot of vision with his E, which also makes way for brush control. Combine his E slow with his W, he can practically handpick a target and CC them for some time while his team just follows up on him."}

This allows you to play safely, chip on your enemy's health bar, and then all-in them with your Q empowered auto-attacks.The amount of utility you bring to a team comp is massive. Your auto-attack slows and your Ultimate w CC can easily help your team secure picks before important objective fights. It also helps you increase CC chains on enemies.Once you get two to three items, you can start slowing and shredding multiple members of the enemy team in close-quarter fights. This gives you a greater time to kite out enemies during skirmishes and keeps you safe from their CC while your team piles on them."}

Junglers can camp him at that stage as well since he will have no other form of escape left, and his E has a very long cooldown.Takes quite some time to scale up due to how his itemization works. This is also dependent on the fact that he is very skill shot heavy and will need to land his Qs on the enemy in order to be effective.Buffering his E won\u2019t work too well if the enemy has some form of ranged CC which they can use to follow-up on Ezreal after he has used his E. This forces him to play a bit more defensively, and he won\u2019t be able to push in the wave either, else he can get run down by the enemy."}

If he miss-times his Ultimate e, his damage output will be reduced heavily and it may cost him the team fight. This is why he needs to cast his Ultimate e as soon as the enemy gets into health range."}

If used properly, it will put the enemy team in a lose-lose situation.Yorick's real power relies on split pushing, and he can do that really well during the mid-game with his Ultimate R. If the enemy leaves Yorick unaccounted for, he will be at their inhibitors in a matter of minutes."}

Katarina has insane AOE damage and if your team is grouped closely together, she will be able to melt you down. Try and fight in areas that leave your team split slightly apart.Forcing a team fight when Katarina\u2019s Zhonyas is down is a good way of taking her out of the team fight quickly.

It will slowly allow you to get a healthy lead in the lane after which you can either look to all-in or roam.Once you get your Ultimate R, you should be able to do a lot more in this lane. The plan is still the same, whittle down your enemy first, and then look to all-in with your Ultimate R. Take the position of the enemy Jungler into account first."}

The former will let him take part in many team fights while the latter will help him with duels.Garen's build will dictate how he plays the game out. If he goes for the tank build, he will be nearly unkillable and can act as a perfect peel unit for his carries. On the other hand, if he goes for the bruiser build, he will be more dependent on the fog of war to catch enemies off guard and pick vital enemy carries."}

This is especially true if Jayce hides in the fog of war and manages to burst down an unsuspecting squishy enemy with his w > s combo. This can also be done from the lane brushes if the enemy doesn't ward them.Jayce's poke is directly proportional to the number of items and components he has at that time.

Avoid committing to fights unless you are certain you can kill her quickly.Keeping the wave closer to your side of the map early will force her to overextend for the farm which you can abuse to all-in her or set up your Jungler.Look out for Lillia\u2019s build. She has a very versatile build path and will build lots of different items. Keep this in mind and buy items that counter her build."}

This can help reduce their ability to heal and trade effectively during skirmishes and all-ins.Maintain the minion wave closer to your side of the map. This encourages Senna and their ADC to overextend, creating opportunities for your jungler to gank and potentially secure kills or summoner spells.Take advantage of windows of opportunity to detach from your ADC and harass Senna when they've used one of their abilities. This puts them at a disadvantage in trades, as they have one less ability to trade back effectively.Be cautious at level 6, as Senna's kill pressure increases with her ultimate ability. Expect them to look for aggressive plays and be prepared to play defensively, utilizing Yuumi's healing and utility to keep your ADC safe."}

When Ryze hits level 6, his kill pressure doesn\u2019t increase as his Ultimate R is not a damaging tool. For most champions, your level 6 will be stronger than his.Try to fight as often as possible. Ryze needs time to scale, so delaying his ability to scale is key. Getting an early kill and putting him behind early will reduce his ability to scale into the mid and late game."}

His Ultimate R amplifies this effect and is really effective when fighting in closed spaces.He can use his W to set-up ganks for his Jungler as well.

He will pose a lot of threats if he can use the ability while hiding in a brush.His tankiness will be colossal during this phase of the game.

She can solo the Dragon with ease and can use her Q to hop over walls and take creative ganking routes.Her Ultimate R can save her team and herself from assassination attempts. The usage will vary depending on how far ahead Kindred is in the game.

This is because the empowerments will be more powerful, and Heimerdinger will use them both offensively and defensively. In addition, it will let him harass the enemy laner relentlessly when they are trying to farm in the lane.Heimerdinger excels during team fights as he can control a large area with his Q turrets.

Don\u2019t be afraid to look for fights once you\u2019ve picked up your first item.While Azir\u2019s poke is good, he is incredibly weak in the early game. Don\u2019t trade too much before your first back, so you don\u2019t fall behind. You need time to come online, so focus on farming and surviving the very early game."}
{"text": "Neutral objective fights and fights in the river will be your bread and butter when it comes to accumulating a lead in the game. Block off choke point with your Q when possible.In a team fight, always try to separate an enemy from their team. Bonus points if the target is immobile and has no form of escape, as it would be a guaranteed kill.Make sure that the neutral objective pit is out of bounds for the enemy Jungler during fights. It will help your Jungler secure the objective quickly and without any risk of missing smite.        "}
{"text": "You will need to be extremely careful about being poked out by the enemy from the lane brushes. Keep the warded and try to catch them off-guard with your r tornado.Look for frequent trades with the enemy throughout the laning phase. Getting an early kill could snowball the lane heavily in your favor.Level 6 is a massive powerspike, so look to play more aggressively. Your Ultimate R is an excellent skirmishing tool, and you can get early kills with it."}
{"text": "When walking around Summoners Rift, do not go alone if you\u2019re squishy. Fizz can easily assassinate somebody who is walking through the river alone. Take appropriate paths through warded areas whenever possible.Do not use any executing abilities or key skill shots on Fizz unless he has used his E as he can easily dodge them by going untargetable.If you\u2019re hit by Fizz\u2019s Ultimate R, do not walk close to your allies as the AOE damage from his shark will deal lots of damage to them too. Walk towards them but don\u2019t get close."}
{"text": "The enemy has pretty good objective control. With this in mind, try and keep it warded at all times with a Control Ward in the back of the pit. This will help your team know if they start the objective and if you\u2019re nearby, you might be able to collapse onto them.You\u2019re much stronger than the enemy in the 1v1. So if you find them walking around the map or near the scuttle crab, you can fight them as long as you have a lot of health. Make sure you check the map for collapsing laners and back off if they come. If the enemy lands their CC, just back off.As discussed, the enemy needs to hit level 6 quickly to make full use of their kit. Try to invade them as much as possible and steal away their camps to delay their level 6 power spike. A good time to invade is when the enemy Jungler shows on the opposite side of the map.The enemies level 6 power spike is incredibly strong. Once they hit it, they will be ganking as often as their Ultimate is up. Make sure you place vision inside their jungle so you can spot them before they gank."}
{"text": "Whenever Karma\u2019s d is down, she is vulnerable to attack and will need to play safely while it\u2019s on cooldown. Karma is squishy, and if she looks to fight when it\u2019s down, she is going to come worse off than the enemy. Unlike most champions, Karma unlocks her Ultimate a at level 1. This means that at level 6, she doesn\u2019t have as much pressure in comparison to a lot of other Supports. Pre-6, this isn\u2019t a problem though.In team fights you need to ensure that you use your empowered d on your allies and avoid using your Q. Using the wrong empowerment can cost you the team fight. "}
{"text": "When no team fights are occurring, put yourself in a side lane and look to split push and farm side waves. Watch what your team is doing in case you need to move to help them at all times.Delay team fights for as long as possible while you try to harass the enemy with your long-ranged r and auto-attacks.Use your Ultimate R defensively in team fights. Use it to protect yourself and your allies from the enemy frontline/assassins."}
{"text": "His y is a great tool that can allow him to escape ganks and skirmishes with the enemy during the laning phase.Wukong\u2019s Ultimate n is a very good tool. It can be used to help his team win team fights, and for him to get kills during the laning phase. Wukong excels at extended trades with his s and k. He is a very strong duelist in the laning phase."}
{"text": "Shen gains global map pressure at level 6 as his Ultimate R can be used to help any of his allies. With this in mind, ping once he hits level 6.Shen is actually strong at level 2 if he can get a good engage off with his E. He can be strong at level 1 if he starts E too.He is really good in the mid-game as his kit is very versatile and can be used to either start fights, bait enemies and save his allies. He will also be stronger as the game goes along as he will get tankier and tankier."}
{"text": "Ashe is much stronger in long skirmishes because it allows her to activate her Q in the trade. Do not go for extended trades with Ashe unless you can kill her. Once Ashe has her Ultimate w up, her ability to get kills increases. You have to respect her level 6 and respect her all-in whenever her Ultimate w is up. Ashe is very reliant on her Ultimate w as it can be used in a variety of ways. Try to abuse her when her Ultimate w is on cooldown as she is incredibly vulnerable while it\u2019s on cooldown."}
{"text": "Go to the mid lane after destroying or losing the bottom lane tower. Rotate with your ADC or hold hands with your Mid laner to prevent the enemy from taking the mid lane tower.In team fights, use your empowered d to provide a large shield to your allies. Unless you need to use your Qor d, you should try to use your d to help them survive.Stay with your allies in the mid-game. Do not move too far away from them at any given time as you\u2019ll be an easy target for the enemy. Similarly, do not go to ward unless your allies are nearby and able to help you."}
{"text": "Taliyah\u2019s early game poke will be quite strong. Once she hits level 3, she could kill you if you\u2019re low enough.Her level 6 is good, but it\u2019s not going to be super useful in skirmishes in the bot lane (unless she uses it to start the fight). Keep this in mind when fighting her.Her first component item will severely increase her damage output in lane. Her Q will hurt more, and you should invest in extra sustain to keep you healthy in this lane."}
{"text": "Do not fight in the late game unless your Ultimate R is up. It is crucial that you only commit or look for fights when it is available as you\u2019re going to miss on the CC it provides.Your Ultimate R will be on a shorter cooldown in the later stages of the game. If you can find an opportunity to do so, use it to catch out someone who is isolated and alone, too far forward or way out of position.Peel for your carries to keep them alive for longer. If your allies die quickly, there will be little chance that you will win the team fight."}
{"text": "Watch your positioning in late game team fights. Stay as safe as possible so you do not get killed first. Cassiopeia is one of the strongest late game champions, so staying alive is key.Stick with your team in the late game. Do not split up or walk away from them otherwise the enemy may try to pick you off or initiate a 4v5 fight when you\u2019re away from your team.Look to initiate and start a fight with your Ultimate R. Being able to land a multi-person stun will make the fight much easier for your team."}
{"text": "In the mid-game, your main goal will be to look for as many picks as you can. Work with your Jungler to help them invade while planting your E sapling in the Jungle brushes.You should be really tanky during this phase of the game. Peeling for your carries should be your primary goal after you manage to initiate the team fights.The river and choke points would be a great place to fight as your abilities will lock down multiple enemies. Just go in on the highest priority target and try to CC lock them.        "}
{"text": "Having three points in his Ultimate R is a massive powerspike for Xin Zhao. This will allow him to use the ability frequently, giving him an overall benefit during fights.Xin will have two of his abilities maxed out by level 14. This is a significant boost to his dueling power, and it will let him dominate 1 v 1's with utmost ease.During this phase of the game, Xin will be really tanky while simultaneously dealing a ton of damage to his enemies. This means that he will be tough to take down, and immobile or CC'd enemy carries will mostly die if they can't get Xin away from them."}
