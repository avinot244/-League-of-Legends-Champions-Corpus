You\u2019ll need to keep a constant eye on your energy levels and only go in for aggressive plays when you have lots of energy.\n\nAkali and assassins like her struggle against teams with lots of CC. In team fights, you\u2019ll have to wait for the perfect opportunity to go in so you do not get CC\u2019d and killed pretty much instantly.\n\nAkali is one of the hardest champions to master in the game. Playing around her energy levels, her Passive, her W and her two mobility spells takes a lot of practice. Expect to put in a lot of effort if you want to learn Akali."}

In the meantime, try to land your {{championSpells.AkaliQ}} on both the minion wave and the enemy champion.\n\nSince you use Energy, and your abilities are energy hungry, you should always take a look at your resource bar before attempting an all-in. Keep a track of the enemy Jungler from the beginning of the game as he will attempt to camp your lane till you hit level six.\n\nUse your E discretely in this lane as it allows you to both all-in and disengage against enemies. Your goal should be to get your first item as quickly as you can so that your all-ins become more potent and deadly."}

Look to trade more often after your first back.\n\nOnce you have access to all your basic abilities, you can start to trade more effectively with the enemy. At level 3, you can look for more aggressive plays, but don\u2019t over commit to them, so you don\u2019t fall behind.\n\nAt level 6, Akali can look for aggressive all-ins as her Ultimate offers her a lot of additional kill pressure. Look for kills with your Ultimate when the enemy overextends."}
{"text": "At this stage, your map awareness should be at its peak. You should always try to shove the wave with your {{championSpells.AkaliQ}} and try to roam towards any lane which has an extended laner. This will allow you to use your {{championSpells.AkaliE}} and Ultimate to catch up to such extended targets, and get rid of them quickly.\n\nWhen you are fighting for a neutral objective and you manage to land an {{championSpells.AkaliE}} on an enemy champion, you don't need to always go-in. This is because your presence, and the threat of your {{championSpells.AkaliE}}, {{championSpells.AkaliW}}, and {{championSpells.AkaliR}} which automatically keeps the enemy carries away from you. This will ultimately result in the enemy team being zoned out.\n\nProper usage of your {{championSpells.AkaliW}} is very important during this stage of the game. If used freely, the enemy laner can bait you into such an all-in and then get rid of Akali quickly. Also, attempt to stay in a longer lane as it gives you more opportunities to all-in someone."}

She can look for more aggressive plays and try to assassinate targets that are isolated or walking around the map on their own.\n\nSince Akali is an Assassin, she should have a few items completed during the mid-game. If you\u2019re able to catch somebody out who is alone, it could easily result in a potential call for the Baron."}
{"text": "At this stage, teams will be closely grouped together so it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll be able to assassinate anyone. Continue to look for picks but expect there to be more than just 1 enemy nearby.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be difficult for you to 100 to 0 someone as many champions will be full build in the late game or at least have defensive tools like Zhonya\u2019s Hourglass or Guardian Angel available to them.\n\nContinue to play team fights slow. While your cooldowns will be short, you need to play around your {{championSpells.AkaliW}} as much as possible to ensure you can kill the enemy."}
{"text": "At level 16, Akali will have 3 points in her Ultimate She will be able to dish out a lot of damage to anyone she comes into contact with. Your Ultimate will also be on a lower cooldown, which is very beneficial.\n\nAt this stage of the game, Akali would be near max build. Landing an {{championSpells.AkaliE}} on a squishy enemy champion should result in an easy kill. This kill could result in either the Baron or a favourable forced 5v4 fight.\n\nAkali does fall off in the later parts of the game as teams start to group. Akali is at her strongest in split fights or picks rather than straight 5v5s. Also, the enemy should start buying defensive items, which will make it harder for her to take them down."}

Try to kill someone and then abuse their death timer to earn more gold."}
{"text": "In the mid-game, teams will start grouping. Thanks to Zyra\u2019s AOE abilities, she will be rather good during this stage in the game as she will be able to deal damage to multiple enemy champions at once.\n\nZyra would\u2019ve also completed multiple items when the mid-game roles around. Because of this, your abilities will deal a lot more damage which will allow you to pick of squishy targets.\n\nAt level 9, Zyra would\u2019ve maxed either her {{championSpells.ZyraQ}} or her {{championSpells.ZyraE}}. Regardless of which one you maxed first, you should be able to deal a lot of damage to the enemy laner during the mid-game or the later parts of the laning phase."}
{"text": "Ward major objectives and place vision in high traffic areas in the late stages of the game. Keep them warded so you can see the enemy move around the map and see them starting the objective.\n\nStay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so you do not get caught out. Getting caught out will result in your team having to play 4v5. Do not ward alone unless you know where the enemy is.\n\nPeel for your allies as much as possible. Keeping them alive for as long as possible in team fights is a must in order to win the game."}

The utility and damage this ability provides at this rank is very good, and she will be a menace in team fights.\n\nThanks to her low cooldowns and plants, Zyra will help her team quickly secure neutral objectives such as the Baron or Elder Dragon. Don\u2019t be afraid to make the call for these objectives if your team\u2019s in a position to do so."}
{"text": "Zyra has good wave clear and can poke the enemy at the same time with her {{championSpells.ZyraQ}}. This is great use of her mana pool.\n\nShe can turn a gank around as long as she has seeds placed down before the enemy initiates. When they go in, she can spawn some plants and potentially turn around the exchange.\n\nZyra has great burst potential and can easily blow up any squishy target as the game goes along."}
{"text": "Your immobility is your greatest weakness on Zyra. Therefore, you should always be conscious of your positioning in lane and in team fights.\n\nDuring a fight, always stay at a distance and avoid crowd control abilities. Once locked down, you won\u2019t be able to do anything to save yourself and will most probably get killed if the enemy follows up on you.\n\nMissing your {{championSpells.ZyraE}} places you in a very vulnerable position, so only try to land it when you can guarantee a hit.

{"text": "Keep using your {{championSpells.ZyraQ}} and {{championSpells.ZyraW}} to farm in this lane. It is really easy to do so while making sure that you take absolutely no damage from the enemy team.\n\nYou're really immobile so make sure you ward up and don't push when you don't know where the enemy Jungler is.\n\nBe a part of neutral objective fights as your AoE burst damage is pretty significant and can easily win you a fight."}
{"text": "Zyra\u2019s will have good early game poke, especially after level 4 when she has 2 point in her {{championSpells.ZyraQ}}.\n\nAt level 6, Zyra can deal a considerable amount of burst damage to the enemy. Her kill pressure increases dramatically at this stage of the game.\n\nWhen Zyra has completed her Mythic item, her damage output and poke in lane will be very high. Her goal at this stage is just to harass and poke the enemy down."}
{"text": "During the mid-game, switch to a longer lane to be safer and work with your team to secure picks. It will help you close the game out quickly.\n\nDo not overextend during fights as you are immobile. The enemy will try to bait your {{championSpells.ZyraE}} out so be very careful.\n\nDuring neutral objective fights, you should be able to disrupt a fight due to your Ultimate {{championSpells.ZyraR}}, especially if the enemy is clumped. Just make sure that you land the ability and use your {{championSpells.ZyraW}} properly."}
