Although a strong engage tool, his E is quite short-ranged and he definitely needs the fog of war to catch his enemy off-guard.While jungling during the early game, Gragas can be invaded early on when he is busy ganking. Doing so will force Gragas to show himself to lanes in order to soak experience as he won\u2019t have any camps to take due to him being invaded. On the other hand, if he is laning, just poking and consistently harassing Gragas will force him to recall abruptly."}

If the enemy team manages to set the proper vision, Garen\u2019s game plan will collapse and he will be useless especially if your team managed to set him behind early on.Due to him having multiple builds, Garen\u2019s effectiveness can vary from game to game. If he decides to go for the full AD build when his team lacks a frontline, he won\u2019t be able to do anything that game if he is set back. This should be a proper signal for the enemy Jungler/team to camp him when possible."}

Misuse of his l can get him killed immediately, especially if the enemy laner holds on to their main crowd control ability. This can make him a very easy gank target.Grievous Wounds are a bane to his existence, especially if it is procured early. This weakness can allow his enemy to get a huge advantage on him due to the reduced Q health."}

He can either melt objectives quickly with his evolved Q or go for a more gank-efficient approach by evolving his E or Ultimate R.The first component will give him a massive damage boost. This will allow him to take over the game relatively quickly if he keeps finding kills. During fights, he should always go for isolated back liners for maximal effectiveness."}

This will allow you to whittle the enemy tower down and possibly take it quickly. Once that is done, immediately swap to the mid-lane as you will be safer there and will be able to get more objectives that way.Before major objective fights, use your k to scout around for death brushes set up by the enemy. Besides that, always maintain your range and use your Q and auto-attack slow to constantly kite the enemy team. You don't want to get caught out by any form of CC as it will spell death for you then and there.If the enemy carry is highly mobile, you may want to save your Ultimate w until you have a clean shot on them.

It improves his r poke damage, which allows him to look for all-ins once he hits level 6. The best time to go for an all-in is when the enemy's primary form of CC is down.Once Yasuo gets his first item component, he will get a significant boost in his dueling potential. This means that he can easily catch up to and kill any over-extended or immobile target. He can also help his Jungler during ganks with his E dash and r knockup."}

Improper usage of her Passive can yield the same results."}
{"text": "You have a lot of presence during the early game. Gank every opportunity you get, especially on pushed-up enemy targets, to get a lead.Efficient clearing is necessary to ensure that you can gank frequently. Don't be a miser when it comes to using your abilities as your Energy regenerates quite quickly.Warding will be an essential part of your playstyle during this phase of the game. The most important thing you want to do is keep a Control Ward in your inventory to use your Ultimate k efficiently."}
{"text": "Dr Mundo\u2019s main power spike during the early game is when he reaches level 6. His Ultimate R offers him a lot of additional protection, and the additional movement speed it provides will make it hard for the enemy laner to escape from his ganks.Mundo can start ganking from level 3 onwards. While his Q doesn\u2019t deal a lot of damage in the early game, the slow it provides is very handy when it comes to ganking his allies.Once Dr Mundo has completed his first item, his damage output and overall tankiness will increase. At this stage of the game, his duelling ability and kill pressure will be very high."}
{"text": "Consistent poke damage with his W and Q which can allow him to push the enemy laners out of the lane abruptly. This can also allow him to all-in enemies once they are low enough after taking the barrage of poke Ezreal has to offer.His Ultimate R has a very short cooldown and can be used freely during the early game to waveclear. This is very helpful when he is trying to clear the wave quickly in order to get a recall.Ezreal\u2019s E allows him to get out of sticky situations with ease and makes him one of the safest ADCs in the game. He can also buffer it in response to CC abilities which will allow him to avoid follow up CC if he manages to get hit by the initial CC ability."}
{"text": "In the later parts of the game, stick with your team and look for picks. Avoid splitting up or being too far apart from them as the enemy may force a fight while you\u2019re nowhere nearby.Play around your Ultimate R and avoid committing to fights while it is on cooldown. If you fight while it\u2019s on cooldown, you\u2019ll miss out on a lot of healing and extra damage, which can make the difference in a late-game team fight.In team fights, flank the enemy to make it easier for yourself to get onto the enemy backline. Positioning away from your team but close enough to join the fight could give the enemy a false sense of security, making the enemy think the fight is 4v5: forcing them to overextend."}
{"text": "Excellent CC chain if he or someone else on his team manages to CC a target. This works especially well against immobile carries.Can regenerate a lot of health with his W and hence outsustain his enemies in the lane. His Ultimate R amplifies this effect and is really effective when fighting in closed spaces.He can use his W to set-up ganks for his Jungler as well. This allows him to catch up to his target while also providing vision of the area. The latter part is very useful when it comes to objective control."}
{"text": "At level 6, Ashe\u2019s kill pressure in the lane increases. Her Ultimate w is very versatile and can set up kills with her team. Make sure you play around your Ultimate w to get kills over and over.Once Ashe has a few points in her y, her poke can be incredibly challenging to deal with. Make sure you harass the enemy as often as you can After your first back, you will pick up your first component item. The extra damage it provides will help you in extended trades with your Q, and increase your poke damage with your y. Start playing more aggressive after your first back."}
{"text": "The all-in potential with his E and Q is really strong. It also allows him to set-up ganks for his Jungler and get free kills in the lane.Kled\u2019s Passive is one of his greatest powers in a full-blown skirmish. He can use it to instigate tower dives and soak tower shots, while if he happens to take a lot of damage and get dismounted, he can easily get Skaarl back.His Ultimate R allows him to initiate a team fight with ease. It can be used as an ability to score picks on immobile champions as well. The team movement speed increase makes sure that he generally gets sufficient follow-up."}
{"text": "During the mid-game, all you need to do is look for picks all around the map. This is the time for lane swaps so it should be easy for you to get kills.Target immobile carries as much as you can. They can't do much to save themselves and you will be able to escape using your Ultimate R.Look for flanks on the enemy team and see if you can catch them off-guard by using the fog of war. This will make team fights really unfair for the enemy team."}
{"text": "Once Camille hits level 3, she can effectively start looking for ganks. This is because she will unlock all 3 of her basic abilities.When Camille hits level 6, her Ultimate R should result in easy kills for her and her laners. A good Camille will be looking to gank as soon as her Ultimate R comes up.After Camille has completed her Mythic item, her kill pressure and 1v1 potential increases heavily. If you weren\u2019t a threat before then, you definitely will be now as your Mythic gives you so much trading power."}
{"text": "His early game ganks are really strong as he has a lot of CC and damage reduction in his kit. He can quite quickly instigate tower dives on low-health enemies.Level six is a massive spike due to him being able to get his Ultimate R.

{"text": "Do not play too aggressive or lose a lot of health early on. Wait to trade and be prepared to sacrifice some CS for XP so you can look for an all-in later on.Once you have a few levels under your belt, look to play aggressive and go for kills. Fizz has tons of burst damage, which will make killing the enemy easier. But again, remaining healthy is key if you\u2019re looking to all-in someone.Once you have your Ultimate R, look for an all-in. Fizz has tons of kill pressure with his Ultimate R and it will usually result in a kill. If you can\u2019t kill the enemy laner, try to roam around the map to pick up kills in the side lanes."}
{"text": "Great pick potential with her E especially when the target is hiding behind their minion wave. Her Q provides for a good amount of wave clear which helps her get lane priority.Extremely useful in team fights due to her Ultimate R CC and damage. This allows her team to play around her and her Jungler to gank her.Her Passive combined with her Ultimate R can be a deadly combo. If she goes AD, she can run any enemy down if they don\u2019t have some form of CC ability on them."}
{"text": "The longer the game goes, the more stacks Cho\u2019Gath will have. This makes him quite strong in the late game.When he hits level 16, Cho\u2019Gath will put the third and final point in his Ultimate t. He will be able to easily bite down on and execute enemies who are caught out of position by his team.Depending on his build path, Cho\u2019Gath will either deal a lot of damage in late game fights or be incredibly tanky."}

The added burst damage will be beneficial when it comes to dealing with squishy or ranged targets.The first component will give Kayn a massive powerspike as it will bolster both his damage and survivability. It will allow him to duel enemies with ease.        "}

This will allow her to abuse and harass them whenever they walk up to the farm.If she freezes near her tower, she can gain a significant CS and gold lead over the enemy. In addition to this, she can use her strong duelling power to chase down the enemy laner when they walk up or overextend.She can use her Ultimate x on her Jungler, which will allow them to gank her lane with ease or help her save them in a team fight."}
{"text": "Putting the third and final point in Akshan\u2019s Ultimate at level 16 is really beneficial for him. In the late game, depending on his items, he may be able to dish out tons of damage to a squishy target.At level 13, Akshan will max out his E. The additional mobility is very powerful in the later stages of the game.Once again, as teams will be grouping in the late game, if he can get the shut down on a marked enemy, he can bring an ally back to life which could turn the tide of the game."}
{"text": "Look to take down the enemy carries. Focus on the backline and try to take them out of the fight. Focus them on your other frontline champions.As the top laner, you need to ensure you don't ditch your team during all-ins and leave them behind. Remember that you are immune to CC due to your Ultimate k and not your team.Make sure you are always on the side of the map that the next primary objective is on. This will let you work with your Jungler to secure picks and negate vision around that area. If you get a pick on the enemy Jungler, your team should easily win the game."}

His ability to melt through enemy health bars will force his enemies to play defensively."}

It all depends on his build! This makes Jarvan incredibly versatile. His Ultimate m is really good in team fights as it can lock down multiple enemy champions at once."}

This will kill most of his enemies if they happen to get CC'd by Ryze."}

Once set back during the early game, he won\u2019t be able to dish out a lot of damage.On missing his E, Mordekaiser\u2019s opponents can easily all-in and engage on him. This is because he won\u2019t be able to displace the enemy team, and the carries will be able to freely all-in him.Early Grievous Wounds can reduce his W damage by a lot. This will help his enemy even out the duels during the early game."}

This ability when combined with her Q, E, and a heavy CC Support, can allow her to get a huge lead in the lane.Her Ultimate R can allow her to escape situations in which other ADCs may not survive. This also gives her the agency to root the entire enemy team with a cheeky usage of her Flash and E."}

This is mainly because she doesn't have any consistent AoE DPS ability in her kit.Her core items should allow her to take up any fight without significant hindrance. She should be focusing on ganking her laners frequently to help them accumulate a lead during this phase of the game."}

You need to wait until your first major power spike to be genuinely effective.Amumu\u2019s first power spike is when he unlocks his Ultimate y. Hitting level 6 is crucial, and you need to hit it as early as possible to help your allies.Once Amumu has completed his first item, he will be much more robust and more of a menace on Summoners Rift. Make sure you find a healthy balance between ganking and farming to not delay your first item."}

This can shut her down during the early game and force her to play defensively.Her enemies can look to all-in her as soon as she misses her W, so she needs to use that ability quite carefully. She will be more focused on getting her Passive stacks in order to be able to carry later in the game.The E invisibility can be easily countered with a properly placed Control Ward. Her Q costs a lot of mana as well and can make her run out of resources if she uses that ability in a carefree manner."}

When he is out of mana, he isn\u2019t a threat and neither can he use his b to escape.Corki is a squishy champion. This makes it hard for him to survive the laning phases against champions with a lot of burst damage and poke."}

He can quickly go into enemy territory to deward the area/set-up vision and then come back.Level 16 isn't that big a spike for Galio. Although his Ultimate R cooldown is reduced and the cast range is increased, he won't have any incentive to use it for himself."}

This is a very powerful spike for Corki as it will allow him to shred through tanks in late game team fights.At level 16, Corki will put the third and final point in his Ultimate e. As teams will be grouping at this stage of the game, he will be able to poke them down a lot before initiating a fight.Corki is very good in the late game as long as he is not behind. Try and avoid falling behind in the early game to make you an overwhelming force to be reckoned with in the late game."}

It is a significant power spike for him, which can very well allow him to single-handedly carry a game.Once he gets three points in his Ultimate t, no low health enemy on the map will be safe. He can just dash in, auto an enemy twice, and then use his Ultimate t to finish them off.At level 13, Graves will be able to deal a lot of burst damage and play circles around the enemy due to his maxed out l and e.

This will boost her healing significantly, which will be extremely useful during team fights.Janna's movement speed, combined with her Passive, allows her to rally her team and pick enemies off in the Jungle. In addition, she can easily disrupt escaping champions with her **Q** and **Ultimate** knockback."}

This will kill most of his enemies if they happen to get CC'd by Ryze."}

So Hecarim should use the fog of war and sit on the top side of the enemy Jungle and wait to kill any wandering enemy champion.Once his h and W get maxed out, he will be almost unkillable as long as he is mobile and manages to stick to his target.

Keep this in mind when diving in with your E.Although you will find it harder to kill carries on your own, you will be quite tanky and deal a lot of damage thanks to the items you buy.

He can now go, and 1 v 1 targets with ease and can completely blow enemies up with his barrels.His early game is weak as he is entirely dependent on items to be dishing out damage. However, he can compensate for it using his r to poke enemies out with ease and use the lane brushes to conceal his barrels. It will catch enemies off-guard and will allow Gankplank to get the upper hand."}

It will also make her a huge threat if she has a better first item than the enemy ADC.Caitlyn\u2019s level 6 is pretty good, but she doesn\u2019t have a combat Ultimate R.

As every item he buys offers him defensive stats, he will be very tanky throughout the mid-game. He should be a giant menace in team fights.At level 11, Dr Mundo will put the second point in his Ultimate R. The additional health regeneration combined with his overall tankiness will be very hard to deal with in the mid-game. He will be incredibly tanky during this stage of the game."}

He can serve as both an engager and a peeler for his team, depending on what his team needs the most at this point.Volibear's pick potential is really high during the mid and late game. This is due to the shorter cooldown of his Ultimate R. He should always try to kill enemies who have been caught off guard."}

This combined with his Passive and Summoner Spells may easily get him a kill on a squishy target.Really good wave clear with his W, Q and Ultimate R. This causes him to gain priority really fast and it also helps him secure objectives with his Jungler.Post-six, he can practically one shot an enemy with his combo while simultaneously re-positioning with his E. His E also makes him quite slippery, which allows him to evade ganks with ease."}
{"text": "After going in with your Ultimate R, be prepared to fall back and peel for your allies in late game team fights.To make getting on the enemy backline easier, group with your team but stay off to the side. If you flank from an unwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid splitting or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you\u2019re gone.Play around your Ultimate R in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is up. Fighting without it will make the late game team fights much harder. Delay fights and be prepared to disengage if it\u2019s still on cooldown. "}

She will be dishing out way too much damage for the enemy squishies to handle, and that too very frequently.She will have most of her abilities maxed during this phase of the game. This means that her damage output will be massive, and her abilities will be up sooner. It should be easy for her to take over the game now."}

If they don\u2019t play aggressive, you\u2019ll struggle to get kills and win lane. "}
{"text": "She is somewhat weak pre-six as she doesn't have a reliable form of CC on her. She should rely on ganking laners who have hard CC.The first item component will allow her to be really tanky and deal consistent damage when around enemies.

She will most definitely win any Smite fight if she uses her E properly.        "}
{"text": "Kassadin is weak early on as he can't get too close to his opponents to burst them down. This is mainly because of a lack of mobility and items until he hits level 6. To compensate, he should play safely and rely on proper vision setup to not die often.At level 6, Kassadin will unlock his Ultimate k. That is his first significant power spike as he can now dash to or away from an enemy depending on the given situation. As the game progresses, this ability will play a pivotal role in Kassadin's success.Once Kassadin gets his first item, he should deal a lot of burst damage to his enemies. Bonus points if he can shove his wave in and look for kills on other lanes. It will give him a considerable boost.        "}

It will allow you to kill multiple targets, especially during team fights.Set up death brushes with your teammates and use your Ultimate a to get picks when possible. It will help you massively pick off the enemy Jungler before neutral, objective fights like the Elder Dragon or the Baron."}
{"text": "Nasus is very weak early and cannot gank at all until he has many levels under his belt.When he hits level 6, Nasus\u2019 kill pressure increases and he can start to duel the enemy. His survivability against invades will also increase too!He can start to gank after level 3/4 depending on when he puts his first point in his W."}
{"text": "At level nine, Irelia will be able to max out her Q. Being her central damage ability, she will be able to outplay her enemies for days now. The sustain will be pretty decent too.Once she manages to get an extra point in her Ultimate R, she will use the ability frequently in the lane. This will lead to her taking more skirmishes and winning most duels in the game.Irelia is excellent at skirmishing due to her mobility, damage reduction, and Ultimate R. Fighting in chokepoints and the objective pits will surely get her ahead in the game."}
{"text": "His e, when combined with his s attack speed increase is a force to be reckoned with. He can get multiple early kills with this combo (and a decent Support if he is ADC). When in the Jungle, the Red Buff can amplify the effects of this combo.His Ultimate c and his Passive allows him to shred through the enemy team with ease when they happen to be grouped together. This gives him a very strong advantage in choke points.He can use his s to scout around and set vision for his team as well. Besides that, his k allows for some crowd control set-up for his team which they can follow up on."}

It will bolster his overall damage potential."}
{"text": "When you hit level 6, more opportunities open up to you. For instance, you can look for aggressive plays or use your Ultimate R defensively. Your Ultimate R is a genuinely diverse tool that can help you gain a lead or prevent you from losing one.After you\u2019ve picked up your first component item, your r poke and damage will increase dramatically. Don\u2019t be afraid to look for fights once you\u2019ve picked up your first item.While Azir\u2019s poke is good, he is incredibly weak in the early game.

He can just dash in, auto an enemy twice, and then use his Ultimate t to finish them off. Using the fog of war to do so is a great way to pick targets.At level 13, Graves will be able to deal a lot of burst damage and play circles around the enemy due to his maxed out l and e. In addition, it will give him an excellent dueling advantage."}

The ability can also be used to safely steal neutral objectives or snipe kills.The first item component will make up for good poke as Lux will use the lane brushes to keep harassing the enemy bot lane.

Besides, if you keep roaming, chances are that your ADC will fall massively behind and will get killed frequently, especially if you are in a low elo bracket. "}
{"text": "After your bot lane has moved to the mid lane, rotate to the bot side of the map or somewhere else on the map so you can continue to farm and gain XP. Try and siege objectives with your team during the mid-game. You have strong poking tools which will allow you to siege objectives with ease. Try to poke the enemy down as much as possible while your team tries to take towers (or the Dragon or Baron).Delay team fights for as long as possible while you harass the enemy and poke them down with your s."}
{"text": "Play safe for the first few levels. While Ekko\u2019s early game is strong, you need to remain healthy so you can look for an all-in after you have more levels under your belt.Ekko has strong roaming potential and is a strong skirmisher. Get priority in your lane and then look to roam and assist your allies.Play around your Ultimate W. It is a strong tool that can help win fights and outplay the enemy. Always keep this ability in mind when you\u2019re fighting the enemy."}
{"text": "Another point in her Ultimate R will see her be the most powerful she can be in the game. She can now slice through the enemy team with proper positioning.Her late-game damage is very high, and she will need to be taken out beforehand if the enemy team has any chance of winning the game.Her 3rd empowerment is essential and will make Kayle very powerful. Her auto-attacks being permanently empowered will do a number on the enemy team."}
{"text": "Adding another point in his Ultimate 2 will allow Xerath to land more shots on targets. It will help him a lot when trying to finish off enemies who have escaped with poor health.At level 9, Xerath's p will be maxed out. It will be obnoxiously easy for him to poke out the enemy laners now, mainly if he uses the lane brushes for the same purpose.Xerath will have a maxed-out 2 when he hits level thirteen. This will deal with increased damage and allow Xerath to chain his p along with it. The result will be a massive chunk of damage."}
{"text": "Level sixteen is a massive power spike as it increases the defensive capabilities of his Ultimate r. His ADC will be really safe due to the enormous shield they will get.Tahm Kench's tankiness will be out of the world during this phase of the game. He can peel for days for his team and get picks on the enemy with his Q.His Q will be on a really short cooldown. This means that his pick potential and poke will increase a lot. He should try to use the fog of war combined with his W to secure picks on the enemy."}
{"text": "Just focus on farming while keeping the wave on your side of the lane. You do not want to overextend, as you will definitely be ganked.You should go for short burst trades when possible. Use your E on the side walls to ensure that you can use the stealth function to escape sticky situations.Once you get your Ultimate R, you should look to fight more often. Just make sure you warm up properly; else, you will most probably get ganked."}
{"text": "Renekton relies heavily on his cooldowns to get a lead. Whenever his abilities are down, he is not really able to trade as much.Similarly, Renekton needs to play around his Fury bar to get the most damage out during a trade. If he fights without Fury or uses the wrong empowered ability, it can cost him the trade. Avoid using your empowered e if possible.Renekton falls off in the later stages of the game as he no longer has his early game strengths when the game goes longer. Additionally, he is really bad in the later stages of the game if he didn\u2019t get an early lead."}
{"text": "You will be able to blow up squishies with your Ultimate e with ease now. Even if they don't die, they will be too chunked to participate in a team fight.You will be able to burn through the entire enemy team with proper positioning. Your 1 combined with your n will be able to one-shot enemy squishies. Use this strategy during neutral, objective fights.Remember that your n placement can make or break an entire team fight. Place it well and from the fog of war so that the enemy team doesn't anticipate it and take necessary precautions beforehand."}
{"text": "Kled needs some time to come online. Play safe in the very early game unless you have a favourable matchup. Once you have a few levels under your belt, you can look for aggressive plays and extended trades. At level 6 your kill pressure increases and so does your all-in. Wait for the enemy to overextend before initiating a trade with your Ultimate R."}
{"text": "Once you get your Ultimate R, you should be able to make picks all around the map with your teammates. Work with your Jungler to do so when possible.During neutral objective fights, you should be able to disrupt a fight due to your Ultimate R, especially if the enemy is clumped. Just make sure that you land the ability.Try to land your Q regularly on multiple people of the enemy team. This will force them to play safely and your team can later all-in them and finish the job.        "}
{"text": "Ward major objectives and place vision in high traffic areas in the late stages of the game. Keep them warded so you can see the enemy move around the map and see them starting the objective.Stay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so you do not get caught out. Getting caught out will result in your team having to play 4v5. Do not ward alone unless you know where the enemy is.Peel for your allies as much as possible. Keeping them alive for as long as possible in team fights is a must in order to win the game."}
{"text": "Very squishy and layered crowd control can get rid of him immediately. He is vulnerable when his t is down, and can be engaged upon if his k movement speed is reduced.His Ultimate t can easily be gotten rid of by the enemy by purchasing Control Wards. Enemy Junglers with leaps and dashes can also bypass these mushrooms by taking odd routes.He falls off quite drastically during the late game and can only resort to split pushing. This puts his team in a disadvantageous state and causes a lot of tension to build up within the team. "}
{"text": "At level 16, Fizz will put the third point in his Ultimate R if he can land it on a squishy target who doesn\u2019t have a Guardian Angel or Hourglass, he will be able to quickly take them down.Unless he focuses on defenceless targets, it will be hard for Fizz to assassinate targets as smart enemies will start to build defensive items to protect them against his damage. They will also start to group which makes it harder for him to pick someone off.A full build Fizz is a very scary fish! The more gold and kills he has, the more damage he will deal in fights."}
{"text": "Gwen is a strong 1v1 champion- especially if she was able to get an early lead. Look to apply pressure and fight whoever on the enemy team tries to stop you.Neutral Objectives need to be secured regularly in this matchup. It will give your team the edge it needs to make team fights unfair for the enemy team.Continue to play around your Passive and your Q in mid-game fights: especially in 1v1 skirmishes. You will miss out on a lot of damage if you don\u2019t play around it.        "}
{"text": "Quite squishy during the early game and hence can be killed easily. He can either be poked down gradually, which will force him out of the lane, or he can be all-in\u2019d by the enemy laner and the Jungler/Support.Once his h is down, he becomes a gank target if he is too pushed up. This will allow his laner to get a free kill on him, especially if his laner manages to use some wave management technique to bait Kennen.Relies on flanks to get team fight wins so proper vision from the enemy\u2019s side will counter him heavily. This will prevent him from getting into the backline of the enemy team and dealing massive amounts of damage. "}
